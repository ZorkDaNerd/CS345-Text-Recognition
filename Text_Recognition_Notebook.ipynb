vernon sat back down breathing like winded rhinoceros watching harry closely out corners his small sharp eyes ever since harry had come home for summer holidays uncle vernon had been treating him like bomb that might go off at any moment because harry potter wasnt normal boy as matter fact he was as not normal as it is possible be harry potter was wizard wizard fresh from his first year at hogwarts school witchcraft wizardry if dursleys were unhappy have him back for holidays it was nothing how harry felt he missed hogwarts so much it was like having constant stomachache he missed castle with its secret passageways ghosts his classes though perhaps not snape potions master mail arriving by owl eating banquets great hall sleeping his fourposter bed tower dormitory visiting gamekeeper hagrid

world harry looked nothing like rest family uncle vernon was large neckless with an enormous black mustache aunt petunia was horsefaced bony dudley was blond pink porky harry on other hand was small skinny with brilliant green eyes jetblack hair that was always untidy he wore round glasses on his forehead was thin lightningshaped scar it was this scar that made harry so particularly unusual even for wizard this scar was only hint harrys very mysterious past reason he had been left on dursleys doorstep eleven years before at age one year old harry had somehow survived curse from greatest dark sorcerer all time lord voldemort whose name most witches wizards still feared speak harrys parents had died voldemorts attack but harry had escaped with his lightning scar somehow nobody understood why voldemorts powers had been destroyed instant he had failed kill harry so harry had been brought up by his dead mothers sister her husband he had spent ten years with dursleys never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning believing dursleys story that he had got his scar car crash that had killed his parents then exactly year ago hogwarts had written harry whole

door it was brilliant sunny day he crossed lawn slumped down on garden bench sang under his breath happy birthday me happy birthday me no cards no presents he would be spending evening pretending not exist he gazed miserably into hedge he had never felt so lonely more than anything else at hogwarts more even than playing quidditch harry missed his best friends ron weasley hermione granger they however didnt seem be missing him at all neither them had written him all summer even though ron had said he was going ask harry come stay countless times harry had been on point unlocking hedwigs cage by magic sending her ron hermione with letter but it wasnt worth risk underage wizards werent allowed use magic outside school harry hadnt told dursleys this he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him cupboard under stairs with his wand broomstick for first couple weeks back harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath watching dudley tearing out room as fast as his fat legs would carry him but long silence from ron hermione had made harry feel so cut off from magical world that even taunting dudley had lost its appeal now ron hermione had forgotten his birthday what wouldnt he give now for message from hogwarts from any witch or wizard hed almost be glad sight his archenemy draco malfoy just be sure it hadnt all been dream not that his whole year at hogwarts had been fun at very end last term harry had come facetoface with none other than lord voldemort himself voldemort might be ruin his former self but he was still terrifying still cunning still determined regain power harry had slipped through voldemorts clutches for second time but it had been narrow escape even now weeks later harry kept waking night drenched cold sweat wondering where voldemort was now remembering his livid face his wide mad eyes harry suddenly sat bolt upright on garden bench he had been staring absentmindedly into hedge hedge was staring back two enormous green eyes had appeared among leaves harry jumped his feet just as jeering voice floated across lawn know what day it is sang dudley waddling toward him huge eyes blinked vanished what said harry not taking his eyes off spot where they had been know what day it is dudley repeated coming right up him well done said harry so youve finally learned days week todays your birthday sneered dudley how come you havent got any cards havent you even got friends at that freak place better not let your mum hear you talking about my school said harry coolly dudley hitched up his trousers which were slipping down his fat bottom whyre you staring at hedge he said suspiciously m trying decide what would be best spell set it on fire said harry dudley stumbled backward at once look panic on his fat face you ccant dad told you youre not do mmagic he said hell chuck you out house you havent got anywhere else go you havent got any friends take you jiggery pokery said harry fierce voice hocus pocus squiggly wiggly muuuuuum howled dudley tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward house muuuum hes doing you know what harry paid dearly for his moment fun as neither dudley nor hedge was any way hurt aunt petunia knew he hadnt really done magic but he still had duck as she aimed heavy blow at his head with soapy frying pan then she gave him work do with promise he wouldnt eat again until hed finished while dudley lolled around watching eating ice cream harry cleaned windows washed car mowed lawn trimmed flowerbeds pruned watered roses repainted garden bench sun blazed overhead burning back his neck harry knew he shouldnt have risen dudleys bait but dudley had said very thing harry had been thinking himself maybe he didnt have any friends at hogwarts wish they could see famous harry potter now he thought savagely as he spread manure on flower beds his back aching sweat running down his face it was half past seven evening when at last exhausted he heard aunt petunia calling him get here walk on newspaper harry moved gladly into shade gleaming kitchen on top fridge stood tonights pudding huge mound whipped cream sugared violets loin roast pork was sizzling oven eat quickly masons will be here soon snapped aunt petunia pointing two slices bread lump cheese on kitchen table she was already wearing salmonpink cocktail dress harry washed his hands bolted down his pitiful supper moment he had finished aunt petunia whisked away his plate upstairs hurry as he passed door living room harry caught glimpse uncle vernon dudley bow ties dinner jack ets he had only just reached upstairs landing when door bell rang uncle vernons furious face appeared at foot stairs remember boy one sound harry crossed his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside closed door turned collapse on his bed trouble was was already someone sitting on it c hh p t e rr t w o dobbys warning arry managed not shout out but it was close thing little creature on bed had large batlike ears bulging green eyes size tennis balls harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out garden hedge that morning as they stared at each other harry heard dudleys voice from hall may take your coats mr mrs mason creature slipped off bed bowed so low that end its long thin nose touched carpet harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase

into dining room promised harry he would flay him within an inch his life when ma sons had left handed him mop aunt petunia dug some ice cream out freezer harry still shaking started scrubbing kitchen clean uncle vernon might still have been able make his deal if it hadnt been for owl aunt petunia was just passing around box afterdinner mints when huge barn owl swooped through dining room window dropped letter on mrs masons head swooped out again mrs mason screamed like banshee ran from house shouting about lunatics mr mason stayed just long enough tell dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid birds all shapes sizes ask whether this was their idea joke harry stood kitchen clutching mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him demonic glint his tiny eyes read it he hissed evilly brandishing letter owl had delivered go on read it harry took it it did not contain birthday greetings dear mr potter we have received intelligence that hover charm was used at your place residence

upstairs uncle vernon was as bad as his word following morning he paid man fit bars on harrys window he himself fitted cat flap bedroom door so that small amounts food could be pushed inside three times day they let harry out use bathroom morning evening otherwise he was locked his room around clock three days later dursleys were showing no sign relenting harry couldnt see any way out his situation he lay on his bed watching sun sinking behind bars on window wondered miserably what was going happen him what was good magicking himself out his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it yet life at privet drive had reached an alltime low now that dursleys knew they werent going wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but way things were going hed probably starve death anyway catflap rattled aunt petunias hand appeared pushing bowl canned soup into room harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed seized it soup was stonecold but he drank half it one gulp then he crossed room hedwigs cage tipped soggy vegetables at bottom bowl into her empty food tray she ruffled her feathers gave him look deep disgust its no good turning your beak up at it thats all weve got said harry grimly he put empty bowl back on floor next catflap lay back down on bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before soup supposing he was still alive another four weeks what would happen if he didnt turn up at hogwarts would someone be sent see why he hadnt come back would they be able make dursleys let him go room was growing dark exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep he dreamed that he was on show zoo with card reading underage wizard attached his cage people goggled through bars at him as he lay starving weak on bed straw he saw dobbys face crowd shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe sir vanished then dursleys appeared dudley rattled bars cage laughing at him stop it harry muttered as rattling pounded his sore head leave me alone cut it out im trying sleep he opened his eyes moonlight was shining through bars on window someone was goggling through bars at him freckle faced redhaired longnosed someone ron weasley was outside harrys window hh p t e rr t 11h rr e e burrow ronl breathed harry creeping window pushing it up so they could talk through bars ron how did you what harrys mouth fell open as full impact what he was seeing hit him ron was leaning out back window an old turquoise car which was parked midair grinning at harry from front seats were fred george rons elder twin brothers all right harry asked george whats been going on said ron why havent you been

head toward front seat grinning you forget who ive got with me tie that around bars said fred throwing end rope harry if dursleys wake up im dead said harry as he tied rope tightly around bar fred revved up car dont worry said fred stand back harry moved back into shadows next hedwig who seemed have realized how important this was kept still silent car revved louder louder suddenly with crunching noise bars were pulled clean out window as fred drove straight up air harry ran back window see bars dangling few feet above ground panting ron hoisted them up into car harry listened anxiously but was no sound from dursleys bedroom when bars were safely back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible harrys window get ron said but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick

learning even if they are bit slow was small click door swung open so well get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room hand it out ron whispered george watch out for bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as twins disappeared onto dark landing harry dashed around his room collecting his things passing them out window ron then he went help fred george heave his trunk up stairs harry heard uncle vernon cough at last panting they reached landing then carried trunk through harrys room open window fred climbed back into car pull with ron harry george pushed from bedroom side inch by inch trunk slid through window uncle vernon coughed again bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside car one good push harry george threw their shoulders against trunk it slid out window into back seat car okay lets go george whispered but as harry climbed onto windowsill came sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by thunder uncle vernons voice that ruddy owl ive forgotten hedwig harry tore back across room as landing light clicked on he snatched up hedwigs cage dashed window passed it out ron he was scrambling back onto chest drawers when uncle vernon hammered on unlocked door it crashed open for split second uncle vernon stood framed doorway then he let out bellow like an angry bull dived at harry grabbing him by ankle ron fred george seized

catchpole lower lower went flying car edge brilliant red sun was now gleaming through trees touchdown said fred as with slight bump they hit ground they had landed next tumbledown garage small yard harry looked out for first time at rons house it looked as though it had once been large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here until it was several stories high so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was four or five chimneys were perched on top red roof lopsided sign stuck ground near entrance read burrow around front door lay jumble rubber boots very rusty cauldron several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around yard its not much said ron its wonderful said harry happily thinking privet drive they got out car

chickens for short plump kindfaced woman it was remarkable how much she looked like sabertoothed tiger ah said fred oh dear said george mrs weasley came halt front them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face next she was wearing flowered apron with wand sticking out pocket so she said morning mum said george what he clearly thought was jaunty winning voice have you any idea how

could have crashed out my mind with worry did you care never as long as ive lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy perfect percy muttered fred you could do with taking leaf out percys book yelled mrs weasley prodding finger freds chest you could have died you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job it seemed go on for hours mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away im very pleased see you harry dear she said come have some breakfast she turned walked back into house harry after nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her kitchen was small rather cramped was scrubbed wooden table chairs middle harry sat down on edge his seat looking around he had never been wizard house before clock on wall opposite him had only one hand no numbers at all written around edge were things like time make tea time feed chickens youre late books were stacked three deep on mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment baking one minute feasts its magic unless harrys ears were deceiving him old radio next sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into frying pan every now then she muttered things like dont know what you were thinking never would have believed it dont blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate arthur have been worried about you too just last night we were saying wed come get you ourselves if you hadnt written back ron by friday but really she was now adding three fried eggs his plate flying an illegal car halfway across country anyone could have seen you she flicked her wand casually at dishes sink which began clean themselves clinking gently background it was cloudy mum said fred you keep your mouth closed while youre eating mrs weasley snapped they were starving him mum said george you said mrs weasley but it was with slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread buttering it for him at that moment was diversion form small redheaded figure long nightdress who appeared kitchen gave small squeal ran out again ginny said ron an undertone harry my sister shes been talking about you all summer yeah shell be wanting your autograph harry fred said with grin but he caught his mothers eye bent his face over his plate without another word nothing more was said until all four plates were clean which took surprisingly short time blimey im tired yawned fred setting down his knife fork at last think ill go bed you will not snapped mrs weasley its your own fault youve been up all night youre going degnome garden for me theyre getting completely out hand again oh mum you two she said glaring at ron fred you can go up bed dear she added harry you didnt ask them fly that wretched car but harry who felt wide awake said quickly ill help ron ive never seen degnoming thats very sweet you dear but its dull work said mrs weasley now lets see what lockharts got say on subject she pulled heavy book from stack on mantelpiece george groaned mum we know how degnome garden harry looked at cover mrs weasleys book written across it fancy gold letters were words gilderoy lockharts guide household pests was big photograph on front very good ioiking wizard with wavy blond hair bright blue eyes as always wizarding world photograph was moving wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all mrs weasley beamed down at him oh he is marvelous she said he knows his household pests all right its wonderful book mum fancies him said fred very audible whisper dont be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go get on with it woe betide you if theres single gnome that garden when come out inspect it yawning grumbling weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them garden was large harrys eyes exactly what garden should be dursleys wouldnt have liked it were plenty weeds grass needed cutting but were gnarled trees all around walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed big green pond full frogs muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron they crossed lawn yeah ive seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bent double with his head peony bush like fat little santa clauses with fishing rods was violent scuffling noise peony bush shuddered ron straightened up this is gnome he said grimly gerroff me gerroff me squealed gnome it was certainly nothing like santa claus it was small leathery looking with large knobby bald head exactly like potato ron held it at arms length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around ankles turned it upside down this is what you have do he said he raised gnome above his head gerroff me started swing it great circles like lasso seeing shocked look on harrys face ron added it doesnt hurt them youve just got make them really dizzy so they cant find their way back gnomeholes he let go gnomes ankles it flew twenty feet into air landed with thud field over hedge pitiful said fred bet can get mine beyond that stump harry learned quickly not feel too sorry for gnomes he decided just drop first one he caught over hedge but gnome sensing weakness sank its razorsharp teeth into harrys finger he had hard job shaking it off until wow harry that mustve been fifty feet air was soon thick with flying gnomes see theyre not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once moment they know degnomings going on they storm up have look youd think theyd have learned by now just stay put soon crowd gnomes field started walking away straggling line their little shoulders hunched theyll be back said ron as they watched gnomes disappear into hedge on other side field they love it here dads too soft with them he thinks theyre funny just then front door slammed hes back said george dads home they hurried through garden back into house mr weasley was slumped kitchen chair with his glasses off his eyes closed he was thin man going bald but little hair he had was as red as any his childrens he was wearing long green robes which were dusty travelworn what night he mumbled groping for teapot as they all sat down around him nine raids nine old mundungus fletcher tried put hex on me when had my back turned mr weasley took long gulp tea sighed find anything dad said fred eagerly all got were few shrinking door keys biting kettle yawned mr weasley was some pretty nasty stuff that wasnt my department though mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but thats committee on experimental charms thank goodness why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george just mugglebaiting sighed mr weasley sell them key that keeps shrinking nothing so they can never find it when they need it course its very hard convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking theyll insist they just keep losing it bless them theyll go any lengths ignore magic even if its staring them face but things our lot have taken enchanting you wouldnt believe like cars for instance mrs weasley had appeared holding long poker like sword mr weasleys eyes jerked open he stared guiltily at his wife ccars molly dear yes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing imagine wizard buying rusty old car telling his wife all he wanted do with it was take it apart see how it worked while really he was enchanting it make it fly mr weasley blinked well dear think youll find that he would be quite within law do that even if er he maybe would have done better um tell his wife truth theres loophole law youll find as long as he wasnt intending fly car fact that car could fly wouldnt arthur weasley you made sure was loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish your shed for your information harry arrived this morning car you werent intending fly harry said mr weasley blankly harry who he looked around saw harry jumped good lord is it harry potter very pleased meet you rons told us so much about your sons flew that car harrys house back last night shouted mrs weasley what have you got say about that eh did you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs weasleys eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed lets leave them it ron muttered harry as mrs weasley swelled like bullfrog come on ill show you my bedroom they slipped out kitchen down narrow passageway an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through house on third landing door stood ajar harry just caught sight pair bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with snap ginny said ron you dont know how weird it is for her be this shy she never shuts up normally they climbed two more flights until they reached door with peeling paint small plaque on it saying ronalds room harry stepped his head almost touching sloping ceiling blinked it was like walking into furnace nearly everything rons room seemed be violent shade orange bedspread walls even ceiling then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch shabby wallpaper with posters same seven witches wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks waving energetically your quidditch team said harry chudley cannons said ron pointing at orange bedspread which was emblazoned with two giant black cs speeding cannonball ninth league rons school spellbooks were stacked untidily corner next pile comics that all seemed feature adventures martin miggs mad muggle rons magic wand was lying on top fish tank full frog spawn on windowsill next his fat gray rat scabbers who was snoozing patch sun harry stepped over pack selfshuffling playing cards on floor looked out tiny window field far below he could see gang gnomes sneaking one by one back through weasleys hedge then he turned look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion its bit small said ron quickly not like that room you had with muggles im right underneath ghoul attic hes always banging on pipes groaning but harry grinning widely said this is best house ive ever been rons ears went pink c h4 p t e r v o u r at f l 0 v rr 11 h blotts ife at burrow was as different as possible from life on privet drive dursleys liked everything neat ordered weasleys house burst with strange unexpected harry got shock first time he looked mirror over kitchen mantelpiece it shouted tuck your shirt scruffy ghoul attic howled dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet small explosions from fred georges bedroom were considered perfectly normal what harry found most unusual about life at rons however wasnt talking mirror or clanking ghoul it was fact that everybody seemed like him mrs weasley fussed over state his socks tried force him eat fourth helpings at every meal mr weasley liked harry sit next him at dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles asking him explain how things like plugs postal service worked 42 fascinating he would say as harry talked him through using telephone ingenious really how many ways muggles have found getting along without magic harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about week after he had arrived at burrow he ron went down breakfast find mr mrs weasley ginny already sitting at kitchen table moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl floor with loud clatter ginny seemed very prone knocking things over whenever harry entered room she dived under table retrieve bowl emerged with her face glowing like setting sun pretending he hadnt noticed this harry sat down took toast mrs weasley offered him letters from school said mr weasley passing harry ron identical envelopes yellowish parchment addressed green ink dumbledore already knows youre here harry doesnt miss trick that man you twove got them too he added as fred george ambled still their pajamas for few minutes was silence

harrys youve been told get all lockharts books too he said new defense against dark arts teacher must be fan bet its witch at this point fred caught his mothers eye quickly busied himself with marmalade that lot wont come cheap said george with quick look at his parents lockharts books are really expensive well well manage said mrs weasley but she looked worried expect well be able pick up lot ginnys things secondhand oh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny she nodded blushing roots her flaming hair put her elbow butter dish fortunately no one saw this except harry because just then rons elder brother percy walked he was already dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned his sweater vest morning all said percy briskly lovely day he sat down only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately pulling from underneath him moulting gray feather duster at least that was what harry thought it was until he saw that it was breathing 44 errol said ron taking limp owl from percy extracting letter from under its wing finally hes got hermiones answer wrote her saying we were going try rescue you from dursleys he carried errol perch just inside back door tried stand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron lay him on draining board instead muttering pathetic then he ripped open hermiones letter read it out loud dear ron harry if youre hope everything went all right that harry is okay that you didnt do anything illegal get him out ron because that would get harry into trouble too ive been really worried if harry is all right will

surrounded by trees that blocked it from view village below meaning that they could practice quidditch as long as they didnt fly too high 4 they couldnt use real quidditch balls which would have been hard explain if they had escaped flown away over village instead they threw apples for one another catch they took turns riding harrys nimbus two thousand which was easily best broom rons old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies five minutes later they were marching up hill broomsticks over their shoulders they had asked percy if he wanted join them but he had said he was busy harry had only seen percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut his room rest time wish knew what he was up said fred frowning hes not himself his exam results came day before you did twelve owls he hardly gloated at all ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing harrys puzzled look bill got twelve too if were not careful well have another head boy family dont think could stand shame bill

gringotts dunno how mum dad are going afford all our school stuff this year said george after while five sets lockhart books ginny needs robes wand everything harry said nothing he felt bit awkward stored an underground vault at gringotts london was small fortune that his parents had left him course it was only wizarding world that he had money you couldnt use galleons sickles knuts 46 muggle shops he had never mentioned his gringotts bank account dursleys he didnt think their horror anything connected with magic would stretch large pile gold mrs weasley woke them all early following

deafening he tried keep his eyes open but whirl green flames made him feel sick something hard knocked his elbow he tucked it tightly still spinning spinning now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw blurred stream fireplaces snatched glimpses rooms beyond his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop then he fell face forward onto cold stone felt bridge his glasses snap dizzy bruised covered soot he got gingerly his feet holding his broken glasses up his eyes he was cite alone but where he was he had no idea all he could tell was that he was standing stone fireplace what looked like large dimly lit wizards shop but nothing here was ever likely be on hogwarts school list glass case

end summer vacation came too quickly for harrys liking he was looking forward getting back hogwarts but his month at burrow had been happiest his life it was difficult not feel jealous ron when he thought dursleys sort welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive on their last evening mrs weasley conjured up sumptuous dinner that included all harrys favorite things ending with mouthwatering treacle pudding fred george rounded off evening with display filibuster fireworks they fiiled kitchen with red blue stars that bounced from ceiling wall for at least half an hour then it was time for last mug hot chocolate bed it took long while get started next morning they were up at dawn but somehow they still seemed have great deal do 65 mrs weasley dashed about bad mood looking for spare socks quills people kept colliding on stairs halfdressed with bits toast their hands mr weasley nearly broke his neck tripping over stray chicken as he crossed yard carrying ginnys trunk car harry couldnt see how eight people six large trunks two owls rat were going fit into one small ford anglia he had reckoned course without special features that mr weasley had added not word molly he whispered harry as he opened trunk showed him how it had been magically expanded so that luggage fitted easily when at last they were all car mrs weasley glanced into back seat where harry ron fred george percy were all sitting comfortably side by side said muggles do know more than we give them credit for dont they she ginny got into front seat which had been stretched so that it resembled park bench mean youd never know it was this roomy from outside would you mr weasley started up engine they trundled out yard harry turning back for last look at house he barely had time wonder when hed see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box filibuster fireworks five minutes after that they skidded halt yard so that fred could run for his broomstick they had almost reached highway when ginny shrieked that shed left her diary by time she had clambered back into car they were running very late tempers were running high 66 mr weasley glanced at his watch then at his wife molly dear no arthur no one would see this little button here is an invisibility booster installed thatd get us up air then we fly above clouds wed be ten minutes no one would be any wiser said no arthur not broad daylight they reached kings cross at quarter eleven mr weasley dashed across road get trolleys for their trunks they all hurried into station harry had caught hogwarts express previous year tricky part was getting onto platform nine threequarters which wasnt visible muggle eye what you had do was walk through solid barrier dividing platforms nine ten it didnt hurt but it had be done carefully so that none muggles noticed you vanishing percy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at clock overhead which showed they had only five minutes disappear casually through barrier percy strode briskly forward vanished mr weasley went next fred george followed ill take ginny you two come right after us mrs weasley told harry ron grabbing ginnys hand setting off blink an eye they were gone lets go together weve only got minute ron said harry harry made sure that hedwigs cage was safely wedged on top his trunk wheeled his trolley around face barrier he felt 61 perfectly confident this wasnt nearly as uncomfortable as using floo powder both them bent low over handles their trolleys walked purposefully toward barrier gathering speed few feet away from it they broke into run crash both trolleys hit barrier bounced backward rons trunk fell off with loud thump harry was knocked off his feet hedwigs cage bounced onto shiny floor she rolled away shrieking indignantly people all around them stared guard nearby yelled what blazes dyou think youre doing lost control trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as he got up ron ran pick up hedwig who was causing such scene that was lot muttering about cruelty animals from surrounding crowd why cant we get through harry hissed ron dunno ron looked wildly around dozen curious people were still watching them were going miss train ron whispered dont understand why gateways sealed itself harry looked up at giant clock with sickening feeling pit his stomach ten seconds nine seconds he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against barrier pushed with all his might metal remained solid three seconds two seconds one second its gone said ron sounding stunned trains left what if mum dad cant get back through us have you got any muggle money 68 they marched off through crowd curious muggles out station back onto side road where old ford anglia was parked ron unlocked cavernous trunk with series taps from his wand they heaved their luggage back put hedwig on back seat got into front check that no ones watching said ron starting ignition with another tap his wand harry stuck his head out window traffic was rumbling along main road ahead but their street was empty okay he said ron pressed tiny silver button on dashboard car around them vanished so did they harry could feel seat vibrating beneath him hear engine feel his hands on his knees his glasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become pair eyeballs floating few feet above ground dingy street full parked cars lets go said rons voice from his right ground dirty buildings on either side fell away dropping out sight as car rose seconds whole london lay smoky glittering below them then was popping noise car harry ron reappeared uhoh said ron jabbing at invisibility booster its faulty both them pummeled it car vanished then it flickered back again hold on ron yelled he slammed his foot on acceler 7 0 ator they shot straight into low woolly clouds everything turned dull foggy now what said harry blinking at solid mass cloud pressing on them from all sides we need see train know what direction go said ron dip back down again quickly they dropped back beneath clouds twisted around their seats squinting at ground can see it harry yelled right ahead hogwarts express was streaking along below them like scarlet snake due north said ron checking compass on dashboard okay well just have check on it every half hour or so hold on they shot up through clouds minute later they burst out into blaze sunlight it was different world wheels car skimmed sea fluffy cloud sky bright endless blue under blinding white sun all weve got worry about now are airplanes said ron they looked at each other started laugh for long time they couldnt stop it was as though they had been plunged into fabulous dream this thought harry was surely only way travel past swirls turrets snowy cloud car full hot bright sunlight with fat pack toffees glove compartment prospect seeing freds georges jealous faces when they 71 landed smoothly spectacularly on sweeping lawn front hogwarts castle they made regular checks on train as they flew farther farther north each dip beneath clouds showing them different view london was soon far behind them replaced by neat green fields that gave way turn wide purplish moors great city alive with cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churches several uneventful hours later however harry had admit that some fun was wearing off toffees had made them extremely thirsty they had nothing drink he ron had pulled off their sweaters but harrys tshirt was sticking back his seat his glasses kept sliding down end his sweaty nose he had stopped noticing fantastic cloud shapes now was thinking longingly train miles below where you could buy icecold pumpkin juice from trolley pushed by plump witch why hadnt they been able get onto platform nine threequarters cant be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as sun started sink into their floor cloud staining it deep pink ready for another check on train it was still right below them winding its way past snowcapped mountain it was much darker beneath canopy clouds ron put his foot on accelerator drove them upward again but as he did so engine began whine harry ron exchanged nervous glances its probably just tired said ron its never been this far before 12 they both pretended not notice whining growing louder louder as sky became steadily darker stars were blossoming blackness harry pulled his sweater back on try ing ignore way windshield wipers were now waving fee bly as though protest not far said ron more car than harry not far now he patted dashboard nervously when they flew back beneath clouds little while later they had squint through darkness for landmark they knew harry shouted making ron hedwig jump straight ahead silhouetted on dark horizon high on cliff over lake stood many turrets towers hogwarts castle but car had begun shudder was losing speed come on ron said cajolingly giving steering wheel lit tle shake nearly come on engine groaned narrow jets steam were issuing from un der hood harry found himself gripping edges his seat very hard as they flew toward lake car gave nasty wobble glancing out his window harry saw smooth black glassy surface water mile below rons knuckles were white on steering wheel car wobbled again come on ron muttered they were over lake castle was right ahead ron put his foot down was loud clunk splutter engine died com pletely uhoh said ron into silence nose car dropped they were falling gathering speed heading straight for solid castle wall noooooo ron yelled swinging steering wheel around they missed dark stone wall by inches as car turned great arc soaring over dark greenhouses then vegetable patch then out over black lawns losing altitude all time ron let go steering wheel completely pulled his wand out his back pocket stop stop he yelled whacking dashboard windshield but they were still plummeting ground flying up toward them watch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for steering wheel but too late crunch with an earsplitting bang metal on wood they hit thick tree trunk dropped ground with heavy jolt steam was billowing from under crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking terror golfballsize lump was throbbing on harrys head where he had hit windshield his right ron let out low despairing groan are you okay harry said urgently my wand said ron shaky voice look at my wand it had snapped almost two tip was dangling limply held on by few splinters harry opened his mouth say he was sure theyd be able mend it up at school but he never even got started at that very moment something hit his side car with force y4 charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as an equally heavy blow hit roof whats happen ron gasped staring through windshield harry looked around just time see branch as thick as python smash into it tree they had hit was attacking them its trunk was bent almost double its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch car it could reach aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched large dent into his door windshield was now trembling under hail blows from knucklelike twigs branch as thick as battering ram was pounding furiously on roof which seemed be caving run for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into harrys lap by vicious uppercut from another branch were done for he moaned as ceiling sagged but suddenly floor car was vibrating engine had restarted reverse harry yelled car shot backward tree was still trying hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up lashing out at them as they sped out reach that panted ron was close well done car car however had reached end its tether with two sharp clunks doors flew open harry felt his seat tip sideways next thing he knew he was sprawled on damp ground loud thuds told him that car was ejecting their luggage from trunk hedwigs cage flew through air burst open she rose out it with an angry screech sped off toward castle y5 without backward look then dented scratched steaming car rumbled off into darkness its rear lights blazing angrily come back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wand dadll kill me but car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust can you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down pick up scabbers all trees we couldve hit we had get one that hits back he glanced over his shoulder at ancient tree which was still flailing its branches threateningly come on said harry wearily wed better get up school it wasnt at all triumphant arrival they had pictured stiff cold bruised they seized ends their trunks began dragging them up grassy slope toward great oak front doors think feasts already started said ron dropping his trunk at foot front steps crossing quietly look through brightly lit window hey harry come look its sorting harry hurried over together he ron peered at great hall innumerable candles were hovering midair over four long crowded tables making golden plates goblets sparkle overhead bewitched ceiling which always mirrored sky outside sparkled with stars through forest pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw long line scaredlooking first years fiiing into hall ginny 76 was among them easily visible because her vivid weasley hair meanwhile professor mcgonagall bespectacled witch with her hair tight bun was placing famous hogwarts sorting hat on stool before newcomers every year this aged old hat patched frayed dirty sorted new students into four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw slytherin harry well remembered putting it on exactly one year ago waiting petrified for its decision as it muttered aloud his ear for few horrible seconds he had feared that hat was going put him slytherin house that had turned out more dark witches wizards than any other but he had ended up gryffindor along with ron hermione rest weasleys last term harry ron had helped gryffindor win house championship beating slytherin for first time seven years very small mousyhaired boy had been called forward place hat on his head harrys eyes wandered past him where professor dumbledore headmaster sat watching sorting from staff table his long silver beard halfmoon glasses shining brightly candlelight several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhart dressed robes aquamarine at end was hagrid huge hairy drinking deeply from his goblet hang on harry muttered ron theres an empty chair at staff table wheres snape professor severus snape was harrys least favorite teacher harry also happened be snapes least favorite student cruel sarcastic disliked by everybody except students from his own house slytherin snape taught potions maybe hes ill said ron hopefully maybe hes left said harry because he missed out on defense against dark arts job again or he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically mean everyone hates him or maybe said very cold voice right behind them hes waiting hear why you two didnt arrive on school train harry spun around his black robes rippling cold breeze stood severus snape he was thin man with sallow skin hooked nose greasy shoulderlength black hair at this moment he was smiling way that told harry he ron were very deep trouble follow me said snape not daring even look at each other harry ron followed snape up steps into vast echoing entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches delicious smell food was wafting from great hall but snape led them away from warmth light down narrow stone staircase that led into dungeons he said opening door halfway down cold passageway pointing they entered snapes office shivering shadowy walls were lined with shelves large glass ars which floated all manner revolting things harry didnt really want know name at moment fireplace was dark empty snape closed door turned look at them so he said softly train isnt good enough for famous harry potter his faithful sidekick weasley wanted arrive with bang did we boys no sir it was barrier at kings cross it 78 silence said snape coldly what have you done with car ron gulped this wasnt first time snape had given harry impression being able read minds but moment later he un derstood as snape unrolled todays issue evening prophet you were seen he hissed showing them headline fly ing ford anglia mystifies muggles he began read aloud two muggles london convinced they saw an old car flying over post office tower at noon norfolk mrs hetty bayliss while hanging out her washing mr angus fleet peebles reported police six or seven muggles all be lieve your father works misuse muggle artifacts office he said looking up at ron smiling still more nastily dear dear his own son harry felt as though hed just been walloped stomach by one mad trees larger branches if anyone found out mr weasley had bewitched car he hadnt thought that noticed my search park that considerable damage seems have been done very valuable whomping willow snape went on that tree did more damage us than we ron blurted out silence snapped snape again most unfortunately you are not my house decision expel you does not rest with me shall go fetch people who do have that happy power you will wait here harry ron stared at each other whitefaced harry didnt feel hungry any more he now felt extremely sick he tried not look at large slimy something suspended green liquid on shelf behind snapes desk if snape had gone fetch professor mcgonagall head gryffindor house they were hardly any better off she might be fairer than snape but she was still extremely strict ten minutes later snape returned sure enough it was professor mcgonagall who accompanied him harry had seen professor mcgonagall angry on several occasions but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go or he had never seen her this angry before she raised her wand moment she entered harry ron both flinched but she merely pointed it at empty fireplace where flames suddenly erupted sit she said they both backed into chairs by fire explain she said her glasses glinting ominously ron launched into story starting with barrier at station refusing let them through so we had no choice professor we couldnt get on train why didnt you send us letter by owl believe you have an owl professor mcgonagall said coldly harry harry gaped at her now she said it that seemed obvious thing have done didnt think that said professor mcgonagall is obvious was knock on office door snape now looking happier than ever opened it stood headmaster professor dumbledore harrys whole body went numb dumbledore was looking unusually grave he stared down his very crooked nose at them 80 harry suddenly found himself wishing he ron were still being beaten up by whomping willow was long silence then dumbledore said please explain why you did this it would have been better if he had shouted harry hated disappointment his voice for some reason he was unable look dumbledore eyes spoke instead his knees he told dumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned bewitched car making it sound as though he ron had happened find flying car parked outside station he knew dumbledore would see through this at once but dumbledore asked no questions about car when harry had finished he merely continued peer at them through his spectacles well go get our stuff said ron hopeless sort voice what are you talking about weasley barked professor mcgonagall well youre expelling us arent you said ron harry looked quickly at dumbledore not today mr weasley said dumbledore but must impress upon both you seriousness what you have done will be writing both your families tonight must also warn you that if you do anything like this again will have no choice but expel you snape looked as though christmas had been canceled he cleared his throat said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted decree for restriction underage wizardry caused serious damage an old valuable tree surely acts this nature 8i it will be for professor mcgonagall decide on these boys punishments severus said dumbledore calmly they are her house are therefore her responsibility he turned professor mcgonagall must go back feast minerva ive got give out few notices come severus theres deliciouslooking cus tard tart want sample snape shot look pure venom at harry ron as he allowed himself be swept out his office leaving them alone with pro fessor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like wrathful eagle youd better get along hospital wing weasley youre bleeding not much said ron hastily wiping cut over his eye with his sleeve professor wanted watch my sister being sorted sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagall your sister is also gryffindor oh good said ron speaking gryffindor professor mcgonagall said sharply but harry cut professor when we took car term hadnt started so so gryffindor shouldnt really have points taken from it should it he finished watching her anxiously professor mcgonagall gave him piercing look but he was sure she had almost smiled her mouth looked less thin anyway will not take any points from gryffindor she said harrys heart lightened considerably but you will both get de tention it was better than harry had expected as for dumbledores writing dursleys that was nothing harry knew perfectly well theyd just be disappointed that whomping willow hadnt squashed him flat 82 professor mcgonagall raised her wand again pointed it at snapes desk large plate sandwiches two silver goblets jug oficed pumpkin juice appeared with pop you will eat here then go straight up your dormitory she said must also return feast when door had closed behind her ron let out long low whistle thought wed had it he said grabbing sandwich so did said harry taking one too can you believe our luck though said ron thickly through mouthful chicken ham fred george mustve flown that car five or six times no muggle ever saw them he swallowed took another huge bite why couldnt we get through barrier harry shrugged well have watch our step from now on though he said taking grateful swig pumpkin juice wish we couldve gone up feast she didnt want us showing off said ron sagely doesnt want people think its clever arriving by flying car when they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could plate kept refilling itself they rose left office treading familiar path gryffindor tower castle was quiet it seemed that feast was over they walked past muttering portraits creaking suits armor climbed narrow flights stone stairs until at last they reached passage where secret entrance gryffindor tower was hidden behind an oil painting very fat woman pink silk dress password she said as they approached er said harry they didnt know new years password not having met gryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heard hurrying feet behind them turned see hermione dashing toward them you are where have you been most ridiculous rumors someone said youd been expelled for crashing flying car well we havent been expelled harry assured her youre not telling me you did fly here said hermione sounding almost as severe as professor mcgonagall skip lecture said ron impatiently tell us new password its wattlebird said hermione impatiently but thats not point her words were cut short however as portrait fat lady swung open was sudden storm clapping it looked as though whole gryffindor house was still awake packed into circular common room standing on lopsided tables squashy armchairs waiting for them arrive arms reached through portrait hole pull harry ron inside leaving hermione scramble after thent brilliant yelled lee jordan inspired what an entrance flying car right into whomping willow peoplell be talking about that one for years good for you said fifth year harry had never spoken someone was patting him on back as though hed just won marathon fred george pushed their way front crowd said together why couldnt weve come car eh 84 ron was scarlet face grinning embarrassedly but harry could see one person who didnt look happy at all percy was visible over heads some excited first years he seemed be trying get near enough start telling them off harry nudged ron ribs nodded percys direction ron got point at once got get upstairs bit tired he said two them started pushing their way toward door on other side room which led spiral staircase dormitories night harry called back hermione who was wearing scowl just like percys they managed get other side common room still having their backs slapped gained peace staircase they hurried up it right top at last reached door their old dormitory which now had sign on it saying second years they entered familiar circular room with its five fourposters hung with red velvet its high narrow windows their trunks had been brought up for them stood at ends their beds ron grinned guiltily at harry know shouldntve enjoyed that or anything but dormitory door flew open came other second year gryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas neville longbottom unbelievable beamed seamus cool said dean amazing said neville awestruck harry couldnt help it he grinned too 85 hh p t e rr s 1 x gilderoy lockhart he next day however harry barely grinned once things started go downhill from breakfast great hall four long house tables were laden with tureens porridge plates kippers mountains toast dishes eggs bacon beneath enchanted ceiling today dull cloudy gray harry ron sat down at gryffindor table next hermione who had her copy voyages with vampires propped open against milk jug was slight stiffness way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving way they had arrived neville longbottom on other hand greeted them cheerfully neville was roundfaced accidentprone boy with worst memory anyone harry had ever met mails due any minute think grans sending few things forgot harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough was rushing sound overhead hundred or so owls 86 streamed circling hall dropping letters packages into chattering crowd big lumpy package bounced off nevilles head second later something large gray fell into hermiones jug spraying them all with milk feathers enrol said ron pulling bedraggled owl out by feet errol slumped unconscious onto table his legs air damp red envelope his beak oh no ron gasped its all right hes still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with tip her finger its not that its that ron was pointing at red envelope it looked quite ordinary harry but ron neville were both looking at it as though they expected it explode whats matter said harry shes shes sent me howler said ron faintly youd better open it ron said neville timid whisper itll be worse if you dont my gran sent me one once ignored it he gulped it was horrible harry looked from their petrified faces red envelope whats howler he said but rons whole attention was fixed on letter which had begun smoke at corners open it neville urged itll all be over few minutes ron stretched out shaking hand eased envelope from errols beak slit it open neville stuffed his fingers his ears split second later harry knew why he thought for moment it had exploded roar sound fiiled huge hall shaking dust from ceiling 8 e car wo uldnt have been s ur stealing prised if theyd expelled you you wait till get hold you dont suppose you stopped think what your fatherand went through when we saw it was gone mrs weasleys yells hundred times louder than usual made plates spoons rattle on table echoed deafeningly off stone walls people throughout hall were swiveling around see who had received howler ron sank so low his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen letter from dumbledore last night thought your father would die shame we didnt bring you up behave like this you harry could both have died harry had been wondering when his name was going crop up he tried very hard look as though he couldnt hear voice that was making his eardrums throb absolutelydisgusted your fathers facing an inquiry at work its entirely your fault if you put another toe out line well bring you straight back home ringing silence fell red envelope which had dropped from rons hand burst into flames curled into ashes harry ron sat stunned as though tidal wave had just passed over them few people laughed gradually babble talk broke out again hermione closed voyages with vampires looked down at top rons head 88 well dont know what you expected ron but you dont tell me deserved it snapped ron harry pushed his porridge away his insides were burning with guilt mr weasley was facing an inquiry at work after all mr mrs weasley had done for him over summer but he had no time dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along gryffindor table handing out course schedules harry took his saw that they had double herbology with hufepuffs first harry ron hermione left castle together crossed vegetable patch made for greenhouses where magical plants were kept at least howler had done one good thing hermione seemed think they had now been punished enough was being perfectly friendly again as they neared greenhouses they saw rest class standing outside waiting for professor sprout harry ron hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart professor sprouts arms

running away with idea that im better at herbology than she is just happen have met several these exotic plants on my travels greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self was murmur interest they had only ever worked greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting dangerous plants professor sprout took large key from her belt unlocked door harry caught whiff damp earth fertilizer mingling with heavy perfume some giant umbrella sized flowers dangling from ceiling he was about follow ron hermione inside when lockharts hand shot out harry ive been wanting word you dont mind if hes couple minutes late do you professor sprout judging by professor sprouts scowl she did mind but lockhart

seconds then remembering he was supposed be greenhouse he opened door slid inside professor sprout was standing behind trestle bench cen ter greenhouse about twenty pairs differentcolored ear muffs were lying on bench when harry had taken his place between ron hermione she said well be repotting man drakes today now who can tell me properties man drake nobodys surprise hermiones hand was first

lunch went outside into overcast courtyard hermione sat down on stone step buried her nose voyages with vampires again harry ron stood talking about quidditch for several minutes before harry became aware that he was being closely watched looking up he saw very small mousyhaired boy hed seen trying on sorting hat last night staring at harry as though transfixed he was clutching what looked like

at this stage your career isnt sensible looks tad bigheaded harry be frank may well come time when like me youll need keep stack handy wherever you go but he gave little chor tle dont think youre quite yet they had reached lockharts classroom he let harry go at 98 last harry yanked his robes straight headed for seat at very back class where he busied himself with piling all seven lockharts books front him so that he could avoid looking at real thing rest class came clattering ron hermione sat down on either side harry you couldve fried an egg on your face said ron youd better hope creevey doesnt meet ginny or theyll be starting harry potter fan club shut up snapped harry last thing he needed was for lockhart hear phrase harry potter fan club when whole class was seated lockhart

say so year with yeti few you need read wanderings with werewolves more carefully clearly state chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic nonmagic peoples though wouldnt say no large bottle ogdeds old firewhisky he gave them another roguish wink ron was now staring at lockhart with an expression disbelief on his face seamus finnigan dean thomas who were sitting front were shaking with silent laughter hermione on other hand was listening lockhart with rapt attention gave start when he mentioned her name but miss hermione granger knew my secret ambition is rid world evil market my own range haircare potions good girl fact he flipped her paper over full marks where is miss hermione granger 100 hermione raised trembling hand excellent beamed lockhart quite excellent take ten points for gryffindor so business he bent down behind his desk lifted large covered cage onto it now be warned it is my job arm you against foulest creatures known wizardkind you may find yourselves facing your worst fears this room know only that no harm can befall you whilst am here all ask is that you remain calm spite himself harry leaned around his pile books for better look at cage lockhart placed hand on cover dean seamus had stopped laughing now neville was cowering his front row seat must ask you not scream said lockhart low voice it might provoke them as whole class held its breath lockhart whipped off cover yes he said dramatically freshly caught cornish pixies seamus finnigan couldnt control himself he let out snort laughter that even lockhart couldnt mistake for scream terror yes he smiled at seamus well theyre not theyre not very dangerous are they seamus choked dont be so sure said lockhart waggling finger annoyingly at seamus devilish tricky little blighters they can be pixies were electric blue about eight inches high with pointed faces voices so shrill it was like listening lot budgies arguing moment cover had been removed they 101 had started jabbering rocketing around rattling bars making bizarre faces at people nearest them right then lockhart said loudly lets see what you make them he opened cage it was pandemonium pixies shot every direction like rockets two them seized neville by ears lifted him into air several shot straight through window showering back row with broken glass rest proceeded wreck classroom more effectively than rampaging rhino they grabbed ink bottles sprayed class with them shredded books papers tore pictures from walls upended waste basket grabbed bags books threw them out smashed window within minutes half class was sheltering under desks neville was swinging from iron chandelier ceiling come on now round them up round them up theyre only pixies lockhart shouted he rolled up his sleeves brandished his wand bellowed peskipiksi pesternomi it had absolutely no effect one pixies seized his wand threw it out window too lockhart gulped dived under his own desk narrowly avoiding being squashed by neville who fell second later as chandelier gave way bell rang was mad rush toward exit relative calm that followed lockhart straightened up caught sight harry ron hermione who were almost at door said well ill ask you three just nip rest them back into their cage he swept past them shut door quickly behind him 102 can you believe him roared ron as one remaining pixies bit him painfully on ear he just wants give us some handson experience said hermione immobilizing two pixies at once with clever freezing charm stuffing them back into their cage hands on said harry who was trying grab pixie dancing out reach with its tongue out hermione he didnt have clue what he was doing rubbish said hermione youve read his books look at all those amazing things hes done he says hes done ron muttered arry spent lot time over next few days dodging out sight whenever he saw gilderoy lockhart coming down corridor harder avoid was colin creevey who seemed have memorized harrys schedule nothing seemed give colin bigger thrill than say all right harry six or seven times day hear hello colin back however exasperated harry sounded when he said it hedwig was still angry with harry about disasterous car journey rons wand was still malfunctioning surpassing itself on friday morning by shooting out rons hand charms hitting tiny old professor flitwick squarely between eyes creating large throbbing green boil where it had struck so with one thing another harry was quite glad reach weekend he ron hermione were planning visit hagrid on saturday morning harry however was shaken awake several hours earlier 104 than he would have liked by oliver wood captain gryffindor quidditch team whassamatter said harry groggily quidditch practice said wood come on harry squinted at window was thin mist hanging across pinkandgold sky now that he was awake he couldnt understand how he could have slept through racket birds were making oliver harry croaked its crack dawn exactly said wood he was tall burly sixth year at moment his eyes were gleaming with crazed enthusiasm its part our new training program come on grab your broom lets go said wood heartily none other teams have started training yet were going be first off mark this year yawning shivering slightly harry climbed out bed tried find his quidditch robes good man said wood meet you on field fifteen minutes when hed found his scarlet team robes pulled on his cloak for warmth harry scribbled note ron explaining where hed gone went down spiral staircase common room his nimbus two thousand on his shoulder he had just reached portrait hole when was clatter behind him colin creevey came dashing down spiral staircase his camera swinging madly around his neck something clutched his hand heard someone saying your name on stairs harry look what ive got here ive had it developed wanted show you 105 harry looked bemusedly at photograph colin was brandishing under his nose moving blackandwhite lockhart was tugging hard on an arm harry recognized as his own he was pleased see that his photographic self was putting up good fight refusing be dragged into view as harry watched lockhart gave up slumped panting against white edge picture will you sign it said colin eagerly no said harry flatly glancing around check that room was really deserted sorry colin im hurry quidditch practice he climbed through portrait hole oh wow wait for me ive never watched quidditch game before colin scrambled through hole after him itll be really boring harry said quickly but colin ignored him his face shining with excitement you were youngest house player hundred years werent you harry werent you said colin trotting alongside him you must be brilliant ive never flown is it easy is that your own broom is that best one is harry didnt know how get rid him it was like having an extremely talkative shadow dont really understand quidditch said colin breathlessly is it true are four balls two them fly around trying knock people off their brooms yes said harry heavily resigned explaining complicated rules quidditch theyre called bludgers are two beaters 106 on each team who carry clubs beat bludgers away from their side fred george weasley are gryffindor beaters what are other balls for colin asked tripping down couple steps because he was gazing openmouthed at harry well quafe thats biggish red one is one that scores goals three chasers on each team throw quaffle each other try get it through goal posts at end pitch theyre three long poles with hoops on end fourth ball is golden snitch said harry its very small very fast difficult catch but thats what seekers got do because game quidditch doesnt end until snitch has been caught whichever teams seeker gets snitch earns his team an extra hundred fifty points youre gryffindor seeker arent you said colin awe yes said harry as they left castle started across dew drenched grass theres keeper too he guards goal posts thats it really but colin didnt stop questioning harry all way down sloping lawns quidditch field harry only shook him off when he reached changing rooms colin called after him piping voice ill go get good seat harry hurried off stands rest gryffindor team were already changing room wood was only person who looked truly awake fred george weasley were sitting puffyeyed touslehaired next fourth year alicia spinnet who seemed be nodding off against wall behind her her fellow chasers katie 107 bell angelina johnson were yawning side by side opposite them you are harry what kept you said wood briskly now wanted quick talk with you all before we actually get onto field because spent summer devising whole new training program which really think will make all difference wood was holding up large diagram quidditch field on which were drawn many lines arrows crosses differentcolored inks he took out his wand tapped board arrows began wiggle over diagram like caterpillars as wood launched into speech about his new tactics fred weasleys head drooped right onto alicia spinnets shoulder he began snore first board took nearly twenty minutes explain but was another board under that third under that one harry sank into stupor as wood droned on on so said wood at long last jerking harry from wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at castle is that clear any questions ive got question oliver said george who had woken with start why couldnt you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake wood wasnt pleased now listen here you lot he said glowering at them all we should have won quidditch cup last year were easily best team but unfortunately owing circumstances beyond our control 108 harry shifted guiltily his seat he had been unconscious hospital wing for final match previous year meaning that gryffindor had been player short had suffered their worst defeat three hundred years wood took moment regain control himself their last defeat was clearly still torturing him so this year we train harder than ever before okay lets go put our new theories into practice wood shouted seizing his broomstick leading way out locker rooms stifflegged still yawning his team followed they had been locker room so long that sun was up completely now although remnants mist hung over grass stadium as harry walked onto field he saw ron hermione sitting stands arent you finished yet called ron incredulously havent even started said harry looking jealously at toast marmalade ron hermione had brought out great hall woods been teaching us new moves he mounted his broomstick kicked at ground soaring up into air cool morning air whipped his face waking him far more effectively than woods long talk it felt wonderful be back on quidditch field he soared right around stadium at full speed racing fred george whats that funny clicking noise called fred as they hurtled around corner harry looked into stands colin was sitting one highest seats his camera raised taking picture after picture sound strangely magnified deserted stadium io9 look this way harry this way he cried shrilly whos that said fred no idea harry lied putting on spurt speed that took him as far away as possible from colin whats going on said wood frowning as he skimmed through air toward them whys that first year taking pictures dont like it he could be slytherin spy trying find out about our new training program hes gryffindor said harry quickly slytherins dont need spy oliver said george what makes you say that said wood testily because theyre here person said george pointing several people green robes were walking onto field broomsticks their hands dont believe it wood hissed outrage booked field for today well see about this wood shot toward ground landing rather harder than he meant his anger staggering slightly as he dismounted harry fred george followed flint wood bellowed at slytherin captain this is our practice time we got up specially you can clear off now marcus flint was even larger than wood he had look trollish cunning on his face as he replied plenty room for all us wood angelina alicia katie had come over too were no girls on slytherin team who stood shoulder shoulder facing gryffindors leering man but booked field said wood positively spitting with rage booked it 110 ah said flint but ive got specially signed note here from professor snape professor s snape give slytherin team permission practice today on quidditch field owing need train their new seeker youve got new seeker said wood distracted where from behind six large figures before them came seventh smaller boy smirking all over his pale pointed face it was draco malfoy arent you lucius malfoys son said fred looking at malfoy with dislike funny you should mention dracos father said flint as whole slytherin team smiled still more broadly let me show you generous gift hes made slytherin team all seven them held out their broomsticks seven highly polished brandnew handles seven sets fine gold lettering spelling words nimbus two thousand one gleamed under gryffindors noses early morning sun very latest model only came out last month said flint carelessly flicking speck dust from end his own believe it outstrips old two thousand series by considerable amount as for old cleansweeps he smiled nastily at fred george who were both clutching cleansweep fives sweeps board with them none gryffindor team could think anything say for moment malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced slits oh look said flint field invasion ron hermione were crossing grass see what was going on 111 whats happening ron asked harry why arent you playing whats he doing here he was looking at malfoy taking his slytherin quidditch robes im new slytherin seeker weasley said malfoy smugly everyones just been admiring brooms my fathers bought our team ron gaped openmouthed at seven superb broomsticks front him good arent they said malfoy smoothly but perhaps gryffindor team will be able raise some gold get new brooms too you could raffle off those cleansweep fives expect museum would bid for them slytherin team howled with laughter at least no one on gryffindor team had buy their way said hermione sharply they got on pure talent smug look on malfoys face flickered no one asked your opinion you fiithy little mudblood he spat harry knew at once that malfoy had said something really bad because was an instant uproar at his words flint had dive front malfoy stop fred george jumping on him alicia shrieked how dare you ron plunged his hand into his robes pulled out his wand yelling youll pay for that one malfoy pointed it furiously under flints arm at malfoys face loud bang echoed around stadium jet green light shot out wrong end rons wand hitting him stomach sending him reeling backward onto grass 12 ron ron are you all right squealed hermione ron opened his mouth speak but no words came out instead he gave an almighty belch several slugs dribbled out his mouth onto his lap slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter flint was doubled up hanging onto his new broomstick for support malfoy was on all fours banging ground with his fist gryffindors were gathered around ron who kept belching large glistening slugs nobody seemed want touch him wed better get him hagrids its nearest said harry hermione who nodded bravely pair them pulled ron up by arms what happened harry what happened is he ill but you can cure him cant you colin had run down from his seat was now dancing alongside them as they left field ron gave huge heave more slugs dribbled down his front oooh said colin fascinated raising his camera can you hold him still harry get out way colin said harry angrily he hermione supported ron out stadium across grounds toward edge forest nearly ron said hermione as gamekeepers cabin came into view youll be all right minute almost they were within twenty feet hagrids house when front door opened but it wasnt hagrid who emerged gilderoy lockhart wearing robes palest mauve today came striding out quick behind here harry hissed dragging ron behind nearby bush hermione followed somewhat reluctantly 113 its simple matter if you know what youre doing lockhart was saying loudly hagrid if you need help you know where am ill let you have copy my book im surprised you havent already got one ill sign one tonight send it over well goodbye he strode away toward castle harry waited until lockhart was out sight then pulled ron out bush up hagrids front door they knocked urgently hagrid appeared at once looking very grumpy but his expression brightened when he saw who it was bin wonderin when youd come ter see me come come thought you mighta bin professor lockhart back again harry hermione supported ron over threshold into one roomed cabin which had an enormous bed one corner fire crackling merrily other hagrid didnt seem perturbed by rons slug problem which harry hastily explained as he lowered ron into chair better out than he said cheerfully plunking large copper basin front him get em all up ron dont think theres anything do except wait for it stop said hermione anxiously watching ron bend over basin thats difficult curse work at best times but with broken wand hagrid was bustling around making them tea his boarhound fang was slobbering over harry what did lockhart want with you hagrid harry asked scratching fangs ears givin me advice on gettin kelpies out well growled 114 hagrid moving halfplucked rooster off his scrubbed table setting down teapot like don know an bangin on about some banshee he banished if one word it was true ill eat my kettle it was most unlike hagrid criticize hogwarts teacher harry looked at him surprise hermione however said voice somewhat higher than usual think youre being bit unfair professor dumbledore obviously thought he was best man for job he was on man for job said hagrid offering them y plate treacle fudge while

said ron hoarsely emerging over tabletop looking pale sweaty malfoy called her mudblood hagrid ron dived out sight again as fresh wave slugs made their appearance hagrid looked outraged he didn he growled at hermione he did she said but dont know what it means could tell it was really rude course its about most insulting thing he could think gasped ron coming back up mudbloods really foul name for someone who is muggleborn you know nonmagic parents are 115 some wizards like malfoys family who think theyre better than everyone else because theyre what people call pureblood he gave small burp single slug fell into his outstretched hand he threw it into basin continued mean rest us know it doesnt make any difference at all look at neville longbottom hes pureblood he can hardly stand cauldron right way up an they havent invented spell our hermione can do said hagrid proudly making hermione go brilliant shade magenta its disgusting thing call someone said ron wiping his sweaty brow with shaking hand dirty blood see common blood its ridiculous most wizards these days are halfblood anyway if we hadnt married muggles wedve died out he retched ducked out sight again well don blame

together harry said hagrid abruptly as though struck by sudden thought gotta bone ter pick with yeh ive heard youve bin givin out signed photos how come havent got one furious harry wrenched his teeth apart have not been giving out signed photos he said hotly if lockharts still spreading that around 116 but then he saw that hagrid was laughing im ony jokin he said patting harry genially on back sending him face first into table knew yeh hadnt really told lockhart yeh didn need teh yer more famous than him without tryin bet he didnt like that said harry sitting up rubbing his chin don think

gettin on well arent they said hagrid happily fer halloween feast should be big enough by then whatve you been feeding them said harry hagrid looked over his shoulder check that they were alone well ive bin givin them you know bit o help harry noticed hagrids flowery pink umbrella leaning against back wall cabin harry had had reason believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked fact he had strong impression that hagrids old school wand was concealed inside it hagrid wasnt supposed use magic he had been expelled from hogwarts his third year but harry had never found out why any mention matter hagrid would clear his 117 throat loudly become mysteriously deaf until subject was changed an engorgement charm suppose said hermione halfway between disapproval amusement well youve

reckon she was hopin she might run inter someone else at my house he winked at harry if yeh ask me she wouldn say no ter signed oh shut up said harry ron snorted with laughter ground was sprayed with slugs watch it hagrid roared pulling ron away from his precious pumpkins it was nearly lunchtime as harry had only had one bit treacle fudge since dawn he was keen go back school eat they said goodbye hagrid walked back up castle ron hiccoughing occasionally but only bringing up two very small slugs they had barely set foot cool entrance hall when voice rang out you are potter weasley professor mcgonagall was walking toward them looking stern you will both do your detentions this evening whatre we doing professor said ron nervously suppressing burp you will be polishing silver trophy room

fan mail said professor mcgonagall oh n professor cant go do trophy room too said harry desperately certainly not said professor mcgonagall raising her eyebrows professor lockhart requested you

eight harry was dragging his feet along secondfloor corridor lockharts office he gritted his teeth knocked door flew open at once lockhart beamed down at him ah heres scalawag he said come harry come shining brightly on walls by light many candles were countless framed photographs lockhart he had even signed few them another large pile lay on his desk you can address envelopes lockhart told harry as though this was huge treat this first ones gladys gudgeon bless her huge fan mine minutes snailed by harry let lockharts voice wash over him occasionally saying mmm right yeah now then he caught phrase like fames fickle friend harry or celebrity is as celebrity does remember that candles burned lower lower making light dance over many moving faces lockhart watching him harry moved his aching hand over what felt like thousandth envelope writing out veronica smethleys address it must be nearly time leave harry thought miserably please let it be nearly time then he heard something something quite apart from spitting dying candles lockharts prattle about his fans it was voice voice chill bone marrow voice breathtaking icecold venom come come me let me rip you let me tear you let me kill you harry gave huge jump large lilac blot appeared on veronica smethleys street what he said loudly know said lockhart six solid months at top best seller list broke all records no said harry frantically that voice sorry said lockhart looking puzzled what voice that that voice that said didnt you hear it lockhart was looking at harry high astonishment 32o what are you talking about harry perhaps youre getting litde drowsy great scott look at time weve been here nearly four hours id never have believed it times flown hasnt it harry didnt answer he was straining his ears hear voice again but was no sound now except for lockhart telling him he mustnt expect treat like this every time he got detention feeling dazed harry left it was so late that gryffindor common room was almost empty harry went straight up dormitory ron wasnt back yet harry pulled on his pajamas got into bed waited half an hour later ron arrived nursing his right arm bringing strong smell polish into darkened room my muscles have all seized up he groaned sinking on his bed fourteen times he made me buff up that quidditch cup before he was satisfied then had another slug attack all over special award for services school took ages get slime off how was it with lockhart keeping his voice low so as not wake neville dean seamus harry told ron exactly what he had heard lockhart said he couldnt hear it said ron harry could see him frowning moonlight dyou think he was lying but dont get it even someone invisible wouldve had open door know said harry lying back his fourposter staring at canopy above him dont get it either 121 122 october arrived spreading damp chill over grounds into castle madam pomfrey nurse was kept busy by sudden spate colds among staff students her pepperup potion worked instantly though it left drinker smoking at ears for several hours afterward ginny weasley who had been looking pale was bullied into taking some by percy steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave impression that her whole head was on fire raindrops size bullets thundered on castle windows for days on end lake rose flower beds turned into muddy streams hagrids pumpkins swelled size garden sheds oliver woods enthusiasm for regular training sessions however was not dampened which was why harry was be found late one stormy saturday afternoon few days before halloween returning gryffindor tower drenched skin splattered with mud 123 even aside from rain wind it hadnt been happy practice session fred george who had been spying on slytherin team had seen for themselves speed those new nimbus two thousand ones they reported that slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs shooting through air like missiles as harry squelched along deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was nearly headless nick ghost gryffindor tower was staring morosely out window muttering under his breath dont fulfill their requirements half an inch if that hello nick said harry hello hello said nearly headless nick starting looking round he wore dashing plumed hat on his long curly hair tunic with ruff which concealed fact that his neck was almost completely severed he was pale as smoke harry could see right through him dark sky torrential rain outside you look troubled young potter said nick folding transparent letter as he spoke tucking it inside his doublet so do you said harry ah nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand matter no importance its not as though really wanted join thought id apply but apparently dont fulfill requirements spite his airy tone was look great bitterness on his face but you would think wouldnt you he erupted suddenly pulling letter back out his pocket that getting hit fortyfive times neck with blunt axe would qualify you join headless hunt 124 oh yes said harry who was obviously supposed agree mean nobody wishes more than do that it had all been quick clean my head had come off properly mean it would have saved me great deal pain ridicule however nearly headless nick shook his letter open read furiously we can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies you will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members participate hunt activities such as horseback headjuggling head polo it is with greatest regret therefore that must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements with very best wishes sir patrick delaneypodmore fuming nearly headless nick stuffed letter away half an inch skin sinew holding my neck on harry most people would think thats good beheaded but oh no its not enough for sir properly decapitatedpodmore nearly headless nick took several deep breaths then said far calmer tone so whats bothering you anything can do no said harry not unless you know where we can get seven free nimbus two thousand ones for our match against sly rest harrys sentence was drowned out by highpitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles he looked down found himself gazing into pair lamplike yellow eyes it was mrs norris skeletal gray cat who was used by caretaker argus filch as sort deputy his endless battle against students youd better get out here harry said nick quickly filch isnt good mood hes got flu some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over ceiling dungeon five hes been cleaning all morning if he sees you dripping mud all over place 125 right said harry backing away from accusing stare mrs norris but not quickly enough drawn spot by mysterious power that seemed connect him with his foul cat argus filch burst suddenly through tapestry harrys right wheezing looking wildly about for rulebreaker was thick tartan scarf bound around his head his nose was unusually purple filth he shouted his jowls aquiver his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at muddy puddle that had dripped from harrys quidditch robes mess muck everywhere ive had enough it tell you follow me potter so harry waved gloomy goodbye nearly headless nick followed filch back downstairs doubling number muddy footprints on floor harry had never been inside filchs office before it was place most students avoided room was dingy windowless lit by single oil lamp dangling from low ceiling faint smell fried fish lingered about place wooden filing cabinets stood around walls from their labels harry could see that they contained details every pupil filch had ever punished fred george weasley had an entire drawer themselves highly polished collection chains manacles hung on wall behind filchs desk it was common knowledge that he was always begging dumbledore let him suspend students by their ankles from ceiling filch grabbed quill from pot on his desk began shuffling around looking for parchment dung he muttered furiously great sizzling dragon bogies frog brains rat intestines ive had enough it make an example wheres form yes 126 he retrieved large roll parchment from his desk drawer stretched it out front him dipping his long black quill into ink pot name harry potter crime it was only bit mud said harry its only bit mud you boy but me its an extra hour scrubbing shouted filch drip shivering unpleasantly at end his bulbous nose crime befouling castle suggested sentence dabbing at his streaming nose filch squinted unpleasantly at harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence fall but as filch lowered his quill was great bang on ceiling office which made oil lamp rattle peeves filch roared flinging down his quill transport rage ill have you this time ill have you without backward glance at harry filch ran flatfooted from office mrs norris streaking alongside him peeves was school poltergeist grinning airborne menace who lived cause havoc distress harry didnt much like peeves but couldnt help feeling grateful for his timing hopefully whatever peeves had done it sounded as though hed wrecked something very big this time would distract filch from harry thinking that he should probably wait for filch come back harry sank into motheaten chair next desk was only one thing on it apart from his halfcompleted form large glossy purple envelope with silver lettering on front with quick glance at door check that filch wasnt on his way back harry picked up envelope read kwikspell correspondence course beginners magic 127 intrigued harry flicked envelope open pulled out sheaf parchment inside more curly silver writing on front page said feel out step world modern magic find yourself making excuses not perform simple spells ever been taunted for your woeful

my feeble charms but one month into your fabulous kwikspell course succeeded turning her into yak thank you kwikspell fascinated harry thumbed through rest envelopes contents why on earth did filch want kwikspell course did this mean he wasnt proper wizard harry was just reading lesson one holding your wand some useful tips when shuffling footsteps outside told him filch was coming back stuffing parchment back into envelope harry threw it back onto desk just as door opened filch was looking triumphant that vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully mrs norris well have peeves out this time my sweet his eyes fell on harry then darted kwikspell envelope which harry realized too late was lying two feet away from where it had started filchs pasty face went brick red harry braced himself for tidal wave fury filch hobbled across his desk snatched up envelope threw it into drawer have you did you read he sputtered 128 no harry lied quickly filchs knobbly hands were twisting together if thought youd read my private not that its mine for friend be that as it may however harry was staring at him alarmed filch had never looked madder his eyes were popping tic was going one his pouchy cheeks tartan scarf didnt help very well go dont breathe word not that however if you didnt read go now have write up peeves report go amazed at his luck harry sped out office up corridor back upstairs escape from filchs office without punishment was probably some kind school record harry harry did it work nearly headless nick came gliding out classroom behind him harry could see wreckage large blackandgold cabinet that appeared have been dropped from great height persuaded peeves crash it right over filchs office said nick eagerly thought it might distract him was that you said harry gratefully yeah it worked didnt even get detention thanks nick they set off up corridor together nearly headless nick harry noticed was still holding sir patricks rejection letter 129 wish was something could do for you about headless hunt harry said nearly headless nick stopped his tracks harry walked right through him he wished he hadnt it was like stepping through an icy shower but is something you could do for me said nick excitedly harry would be asking too much but no you wouldnt want what is it said harry well this halloween will be my five hundredth deathday said nearly headless nick drawing himself up looking dignified oh said harry not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this right im holding party down one roomier dungeons friends will be coming from

harry quickly ill come my dear boy harry potter at my deathday party he hesitated looking excited do you think you could possibly mention sir patrick how very frightening impressive you find me course said harry nearly headless nick beamed at him deathday party said hermione keenly when harry had changed at last joined her ron common room bet arent many living people who can say theyve been one those itll be fascinating 130 why would anyone want celebrate day they died said ron who was halfway through his potions homework grumpy sounds dead depressing me rain was still lashing windows which were now inky black but inside all looked bright cheerful firelight glowed over countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading talking doing homework or case fred george weasley trying find out what would happen if you fed filibuster firework salamander fred had rescued brilliant orange firedwelling lizard from care magical creatures class it was now smouldering gently on table surrounded by knot curious people harry was at point telling ron hermione about filch kwikspell course when salamander suddenly whizzed into air emitting loud sparks bangs as it whirled wildly round room sight percy bellowing himself hoarse at fred george spectacular display tangerine stars showering from salamanders mouth its escape into fire with accompanying explosions drove both filch kwikspell envelope from harrys mind by time halloween arrived harry was regretting his rash promise go deathday party rest school was happily anticipating their halloween feast great hall had been decorated with usual live bats hagrids vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men sit were rumors that dumbledore had booked troupe dancing skeletons for entertainment promise is promise hermione reminded harry bossily you said youd go deathday party so at seven oclock harry ron hermione walked straight past doorway packed great hall which was glittering invitingly with gold plates candles directed their steps instead toward dungeons 131 passageway leading nearly headless nicks party had been lined with candles too though effect was far from cheerful these were long thin jetblack tapers all burning bright blue casting dim ghostly light even over their own living faces temperature dropped with every step they took as harry shivered drew his robes tightly around him he heard what sounded like thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard is that supposed be music ron whispered they turned corner saw nearly headless nick standing at doorway hung with black velvet drapes my dear friends he said mournfully welcome welcome so pleased you could come he swept off his plumed hat bowed them inside it was an incredible sight dungeon was full hundreds pearlywhite translucent people mostly drifting around crowded dance floor waltzing dreadful quavering sound thirty musical saws played by an orchestra on raised blackdraped platform chandelier overhead blazed midnightblue with thousand more black candles their breath rose mist before them it was like stepping into freezer shall we have look around harry suggested wanting warm up his feet careful not walk through anyone said ron nervously they set off around edge dance floor they passed group gloomy nuns ragged man wearing chains fat friar cheerful hufflepuff ghost who was talking knight with an arrow sticking out his forehead harry wasnt surprised see that bloody baron gaunt staring slytherin ghost covered silver bloodstains was being given wide berth by other ghosts 132 oh no said hermione stopping abruptly turn back turn back dont want talk moaning myrtle who said harry as they backtracked quickly she haunts one toilets girls bathroom on first floor said hermione she haunts toilet yes its been outoforder all year because she keeps having tantrums flooding place never went anyway if could avoid it its awful trying have pee with her wailing at you look food said ron on other side dungeon was long table also covered black velvet they approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped their tracks horrified smell was quite disgusting large rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters cakes burned charcoalblack were heaped on salvers was great maggoty haggis slab cheese covered furry green mold pride place an enormous gray cake shape tombstone with tarlike icing forming words sir nicholas de mimsyporpington died 31st october 1492 harry watched amazed as portly ghost approached table crouched low walked through it his mouth held wide so that it passed through one stinking salmon can you taste it if you walk though it harry asked him almost said ghost sadly he drifted away 133 expect theyve let it rot give it stronger flavor said hermione knowledgeably pinching her nose leaning closer look at putrid haggis can we move feel sick said ron they had barely turned around however when little man swooped suddenly from under table came halt midair before them hello peeves said harry cautiously unlike ghosts around them peeves poltergeist was very reverse pale transparent he was wearing bright orange party hat revolving bow tie broad grin on his wide wicked face nibbles he said sweetly offering them bowl peanuts covered fungus no thanks said hermione heard you talking about poor myrtle said peeves his eyes dancing rude you was about poor myrtle he took deep breath bellowed oy myrtle oh no peeves dont tell her what said shell be really upset hermione whispered frantically didnt mean it dont mind her er hello myrtle squat ghost girl had glided over she had glummest face harry had ever seen halfhidden behind lank hair thick pearly spectacles what she said sulkily how are you myrtle said hermione falsely bright voice its nice see you out toilet 134 myrtle sniffed miss granger was just talking about you said peeves slyly myrtles ear just saying saying how nice you look tonight said hermione glaring at peeves myrtle eyed hermione suspiciously youre making fun me she said silver tears welling rapidly her small seethrough eyes no honestly didnt just say how nice myrtles looking said hermione nudging harry ron painfully ribs oh yeah she did dont lie me myrtle gasped tears now flooding down her face while peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder dyou think dont know what people call me behind my back fat myrtle ugly myrtle miserable moaning moping myrtle youve forgotten pimply peeves hissed her ear moaning myrtle burst into anguished sobs fled from dungeon peeves shot after her pelting her with moldy peanuts yelling pimply pimply oh dear said hermione sadly nearly headless nick now drifted toward them through crowd 135 enjoying yourselves oh yes they lied not bad turnout said nearly headless nick proudly wailing widow came all way up from kent its nearly time for my speech id better go warn orchestra orchestra however stopped playing at that very moment they everyone else dungeon fell silent looking around excitement as hunting horn sounded oh here we go said nearly headless nick bitterly through dungeon wall burst dozen ghost horses each ridden by headless horseman assembly clapped wildly harry started clap too but stopped quickly at sight nicks face horses galloped into middle dance floor halted rearing plunging at front pack was large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm from which position he was blowing horn ghost leapt down lifted his head high air so he could see over crowd everyone laughed strode over nearly headless nick squashing his head back onto his neck nick he roared how are you head still hanging he gave hearty guffaw clapped nearly headless nick on shoulder welcome patrick said nick stiffly live uns said sir patrick spotting harry ron hermione giving huge fake jump astonishment so that his head fell off again crowd howled with laughter 136 very amusing said nearly headless nick darkly dont mind nick shouted sir patricks head from floor still upset we wont let him join hunt but mean say look at fellow think said harry hurriedly at meaningful look from nick nicks very frightening er ha yelled sir patricks head bet he asked you say that if could have everyones attention its time for my speech said nearly headless nick loudly striding toward podium climbing into an icy blue spotlight my late lamented lords ladies gentlemen it is my great sorrow but nobody heard much more sir patrick rest headless hunt had just started game head hockey crowd were turning watch nearly headless nick tried vainly recapture his audience but gave up as sir patricks head went sailing past him loud cheers harry was very cold by now not mention hungry cant stand much more this ron muttered his teeth chattering as orchestra ground back into action ghosts swept back onto dance floor lets go harry agreed they backed toward door nodding beaming at anyone who looked at them minute later were hurrying back up passageway full black candles pudding might not be finished yet said ron hopefully leading way toward steps entrance hall 137 then harry heard it rip tear kill it was same voice same cold murderous voice he had heard lockharts office he stumbled halt clutching at stone wall listening with all his might looking around squinting up down dimly lit passageway harry whatre you its that voice again shut up minute soo hungry for so long listen said harry urgently ron hermione froze watching him kill time kill voice was growing fainter harry was sure it was moving away moving upward mixture fear excitement gripped him as he stared at dark ceiling how could it be moving upward was it phantom whom stone ceilings didnt matter this way he shouted he began run up stairs into entrance hall it was no good hoping hear anything here babble talk from halloween feast was echoing out great hall harry sprinted up marble staircase first floor ron hermione clattering behind him harry whatre we shh 138 harry strained his ears distantly from floor above growing fainter still he heard voice smell blood smell blood his stomach lurched its going kill someone he shouted ignoring rons hermiones bewildered faces he ran up next flight steps three at time trying listen over his own pounding footsteps harry hurtled around whole second floor ron hermione panting behind him not stopping until they turned corner into last deserted passage harry what was that all about said ron wiping sweat off his face couldnt hear anything but hermione gave sudden gasp pointing down corridor look something was shining on wall ahead they approached slowly squinting through darkness foothigh words had been daubed on wall between two windows shimmering light cast by flaming torches chamber secrets has been opened enemies heir beware whats that thing hanging underneath said ron slight quiver his voice as they edged nearer harry almost slipped was large puddle water on floor ron hermione grabbed him they inched toward message eyes fixed on dark shadow beneath it all three them realized what it was at once leapt backward with splashmrs norris caretakers cat was hanging by her tail from torch bracket she was stiff as board her eyes wide staring for few seconds they didnt move then ron said lets get out here shouldnt we try help harry began awkwardly trust me said ron we dont want be found here but it was too late rumble as though distant thunder told them that feast had just ended from either end corridor where they stood came sound hundreds feet climbing stairs loud happy talk wellfed people next moment students were crashing into passage from both ends chatter bustle noise died suddenly as people front spotted hanging cat harry ron hermione stood alone middle corridor as silence fell among mass students pressing forward see grisly sight then someone shouted through quiet enemies heir beware youll be next mudbloods it was draco malfoy he had pushed front crowd his cold eyes alive his usually bloodless face flushed as he grinned at sight hanging immobile cat c h p t x ir n n e wrtiting on wall whats going on here whats going on attracted no doubt by malfoys shout argus filch came shouldering his way through crowd then he saw mrs norris fell back clutching his face horror my cat my cat whats happened mrs norris he shrieked his popping eyes fell on harry youhe screeched you youve murdered my cat youve killed her ill kill you ill argus dumbledore had arrived on scene followed by number other teachers seconds he had swept past harry ron hermione detached mrs norris from torch bracket come with me argus he said filch you too mr potter mr weasley miss granger lockhart stepped forward eagerly 140 my office is nearest headmaster just upstairs please feel free thank you gilderoy said dumbledore silent crowd parted let them pass lockhart looking excited important hurried after dumbledore so did professors mcgonagall snape as they entered lockharts darkened office was flurry movement across walls harry saw several lockharts pictures dodging out sight their hair rollers real lockhart lit candles on his desk stood back dumbledore lay mrs norris on polished surface began examine her harry ron hermione exchanged tense looks sank into chairs outside pool candlelight watching tip dumbledores long crooked nose was barely an inch from mrs norriss fur he was looking at her closely through his halfmoon spectacles his long fingers gently prodding poking professor mcgonagall was bent almost as close her eyes narrowed snape loomed behind them half shadow wearing most peculiar expression it was as though he was trying hard not smile lockhart was hovering around all them making suggestions it was definitely curse that killed her probably transmogrifian torture ive seen it used many times so unlucky wasnt know very countercurse that would have saved her lockharts comments were punctuated by filchs dry racking sobs he was slumped chair by desk unable look at mrs norris his face his hands much as he detested filch harry 141 couldnt help feeling bit sorry for him though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch he would be expelled for sure dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath tapping mrs norris with his wand but nothing happened she continued look as though she had been recently stuffed remember something very similar happening ouagadogou said lockhart series attacks full storys my autobiography was able provide townsfolk with various amulets which cleared matter up at once photographs lockhart on walls were all nodding agreement as he talked one them had forgotten remove his hair net at last dumbledore straightened up shes not dead argus he said softly lockhart stopped abruptly middle counting number murders he had prevented not dead choked filch looking through his fingers at mrs norris but whys she all all stiff frozen she has been petrified said dumbledore ah thought so said lockhart but how cannot say ask him shrieked filch turning his blotched tearstained face harry no second year could have done this said dumbledore firmly it would take dark magic most advanced he did it he did it filch spat his pouchy face purpling you saw what he wrote on wall he found my office he knows im im filchs face worked horribly he knows im squib he finished 142 never touched mrs norris harry said loudly uncomfortably aware everyone looking at him including all lockharts on walls dont even know what squib is rubbish snarled filch he saw my kwikspell letter if might speak headmaster said snape from shadows harrys sense forboding increased he was sure nothing snape had say was going do him any good potter his friends may have simply been wrong place at wrong time he said slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it but we do have set suspicious circumstances here why was he upstairs corridor at all why wasnt he at halloween feast harry ron hermione all launched into an explanation about deathday party were hundreds ghosts theyll tell you we were but why not join feast afterward said snape his black eyes glittering candlelight why go up that corridor ron hermione looked at harry because because harry said his heart thumping very fast something told him it would sound very farfetched if he told them he had been led by bodiless voice no one but he could hear because we were tired wanted go bed he said without any supper said snape triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face didnt think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties we werent hungry said ron loudly as his stomach gave huge rumble snapes nasty smile widened 143 suggest headmaster that potter is not being entirely truthful he said it might be good idea if he were deprived certain privileges until he is ready tell us whole story personally feel he should be taken off gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready be honest really severus said professor mcgonagall sharply see no reason stop boy playing quidditch this cat wasnt hit over head with broomstick is no evidence at all that potter has done anything wrong dumbledore was giving harry searching look his twinkling light blue gaze made harry feel as though he were being xrayed innocent until proven guilty severus he said firmly snape looked furious so did filch my cat has been petrified he shrieked his eyes popping want see some punishment we will be able cure her argus said dumbledore patiently professer sprout recently managed procure some mandrakes as soon as they have reached their full size will have potion made that will revive mrs norris ill make it lockhart butted must have done it hundred times could whip up mandrake restorative draught my sleep excuse me said snape icily but believe am potions master at this school was very awkward pause you may go dumbledore said harry ron hermione they went as quickly as they could without actually running when they were floor up from lockharts office they turned into 144 an empty classroom closed door quietly behind them harry squinted at his friends darkened faces dyou think should have told them about that voice heard no said ron without hesitation hearing voices no one else can hear isnt good sign even wizarding world something rons voice made harry ask you do believe me dont you course do said ron quickly but you must admit its weird know its weird said harry whole things weird what was that writing on wall about cbamber has been opened whats that supposed mean you know it rings sort bell said ron slowly think someone told me story about secret chamber at hogwarts once mightve been bill what on earths squib said harry his surprise ron stifled snigger well its not funny really but as its filch he said squib is someone who was born into wizarding family but hasnt got any magic powers kind opposite muggleborn wizards but squibs are quite unusual if filchs trying learn magic from kwikspell course reckon he must be squib it would explain lot like why he hates students so much ron gave satisfied smile hes bitter clock chimed somewhere midnight said harry wed better get bed before snape comes along tries frame us for something else 145 for few days school could talk little else but attack on mrs norris filch kept it fresh everyones minds by pacing spot where she had been attacked as though he thought attacker might come back harry had seen him scrubbing message on wall with mrs skowers allpurpose magical mess remover but no effect words still gleamed as brightly as ever on stone when filch wasnt guarding scene crime he was skulking red eyed through corridors lunging out at unsuspecting students trying put them detention for things like breathing loudly looking happy ginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs norriss fate according ron she was great cat lover but you havent really got know mrs norris ron told her bracingly honestly were much better off without her ginnys lip trembled stuff like this doesnt often happen at hogwarts ron assured her theyll catch maniac who did it have him out here no time just hope hes got time petrify filch before hes expelled im only joking ron added hastily as ginny blanched attack had also had an effect on hermione it was quite usual for hermione spend lot time reading but she was now doing almost nothing else nor could harry ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up not until following wednesday did they find out harry had been held back potions where snape had made him stay behind scrape tubeworms off desks after hurried lunch he went upstairs meet ron library saw justin finch fletchley hufflepuff boy from herbology coming 146 toward him harry had just opened his mouth say hello when justin caught sight him turned abruptly sped off opposite direction harry found ron at back library measuring his history magic homework professor binns had asked for threefootlong composition on medieval assembly european wizards dont believe it im still eight inches short said ron fu riously letting go his parchment which sprang back into roll hermiones done four feet seven inches her writings tiny where is she asked harry grabbing tape measure unrolling his own homework somewhere over said ron pointing along shelves looking for another book think shes trying read whole library before christmas harry told ron about justin finchfletchley running away from him dunno why you care thought he was bit an idiot said ron scribbling away making his writing as large as possible all that junk about lockhart being so great hermione emerged from between bookshelves she looked irritable at last seemed ready talk them all copies hogwarts history have been taken out she said sitting down next harry ron theres twoweek waiting list wish hadnt left my copy at home but couldnt fit it my trunk with all lockhart books why do you want it said harry 141 same reason everyone else wants it said hermione read up on legend chamber secrets whats that said harry quickly thats just it cant remember said hermione biting her lip cant find story anywhere else hermione let me read your composition said ron desperately checking his watch no wont said hermione suddenly severe youve had ten days finish it only need another two inches come on bell rang ron hermione led way history magic bickering history magic was dullest subject on their schedule professor binns who taught it was their only ghost teacher most exciting thing that ever happened his classes was his entering room through blackboard ancient shriveled many people said he hadnt noticed he was dead he had simply got up teach one day left his body behind him an armchair front staff room fire his routine had not varied slightest since today was as boring as ever professor binns opened his notes began read flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone class was deep stupor occasionally coming long enough copy down name or date then falling asleep again he had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before hermione put up her hand professor binns glancing up middle deadly dull lec 148 ture on international warlock convention 1289 looked amazed miss er granger professor was wondering if you could tell us anything about chamber secrets said hermione clear voice dean thomas who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open gazing out window jerked out his trance lavender browns head came up off her arms neville longbottoms elbow slipped off his desk professor binns blinked my subject is history magic he said his dry wheezy voice deal with facts miss granger not myths legends he cleared his throat with small noise like chalk sping continued september that year subcommittee sardinian sorcerers he stuttered halt hermiones hand was waving air again miss grant please sir dont legends always have basis fact professor binns was looking at her such amazement harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before alive or dead well said professor binns slowly yes one could argue that suppose he peered at hermione as though he had never seen student properly before however legend which you speak is such very sensational even ludicrous tale but whole class was now hanging on professor binnss every word he looked dimly at them all every face turned his harry 149 could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show interest oh very well he said slowly let me see chamber secrets you all know course that hogwarts was founded over thousand years ago precise date is uncertain by four greatest witches wizards age four school houses are named after them godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw salazar slytherin they built this castle together far from prying muggle eyes for it was an age when magic was feared by common people witches wizards suffered much persecution he paused gazed blearily around room continued for few years founders worked harmony together seeking out youngsters who showed signs magic bringing them castle be educated but then disagreements sprang up between them rift began grow between slytherin others slytherin wished be more selective about students admitted hogwarts he believed that magical learning should be kept within allmagic families he disliked taking students muggle parentage believing them be untrustworthy after while was serious argument on subject between slytherin gryffindor slytherin left school professor binns paused again pursing his lips looking like wrinkled old tortoise reliable historical sources tell us this much he said but these honest facts have been obscured by fanciful legend chamber secrets story goes that slytherin had built 150 hidden chamber castle which other founders knew nothing slytherin according legend sealed chamber secrets so that none would be able open it until his own true heir arrived at school heir alone would be able unseal chamber secrets unleash horror within use it purge school all who were unworthy study magic was silence as he finished telling story but it wasnt usual sleepy silence that filled professor binnss classes was unease air as everyone continued watch him hoping for more professor binns looked faintly annoyed whole thing is arrant nonsense course he said naturally school has been searched for evidence such chamber many times by most learned witches wizards it does not exist tale told frighten gullible hermiones hand was back air sir what exactly do you mean by horror within chamber that is believed be some sort monster which heir slytherin alone can control said professor binns his dry reedy voice class exchanged nervous looks tell you thing does not exist said professor binns shuffling his notes is no chamber no monster but sir said seamus finnigan if chamber can only be opened by slytherins true heir no one else would be able find it would they nonsense oflaherty said professor binns an aggravated 151 tone if long succession hogwarts headmasters headmistresses havent found thing but professor piped up parvati patil youd probably have use dark magic open it just because wizard doesnt use dark magic doesnt mean he cant miss pennyfeather snapped professor binns repeat if likes dumbledore but maybe youve got be related slytherin so dumbledore couldnt began dean thomas but professor binns had had enough that will do he said sharply it is myth it does not exist is not shred evidence that slytherin ever built so much as secret broom cupboard regret telling you such foolish story we will return if you please history solid believable verifiable fact within five minutes class had sunk back into its usual torpor always knew salazar slytherin was twisted old loony ron told harry hermione as they fought their way through teeming corridors at end lesson drop off their bags before dinner but never knew he started all this pureblood stuff wouldnt be his house if you paid me honestly if sorting hat had tried put me slytherin idve got train straight back home hermione nodded fervently but harry didnt say anything his stomach had just dropped unpleasantly harry had never told ron hermione that sorting hat 152 had seriously considered putting him slytherin he could remember as though it were yesterday small voice that had spoken his ear when hed placed hat on his head year before you could be great you know its all here your head slytherin would help you on way greatness no doubt about that but harry who had already heard slytherin houses reputa tion for turning out dark wizards had thought desperately not slytherin hat had said oh well if youre sure better be gryffindor as they were shunted along throng colin creevy went past hiya harry hullo colin said harry automatically harry harry boy my class has been saying youre but colin was so small he couldnt fight against tide people bearing him toward great hall they heard him squeak see you harry he was gone whats boy his class saying about you hermione wondered that im slytherins heir expect said harry his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered way justin finch fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime people herell believe anything said ron disgust crowd thinned they were able climb next staircase without difficulty dyou really think theres chamber secrets ron asked hermione dont know she said frowning dumbledore couldnt cure 15 mrs norris that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be well human as she spoke they turned corner found themselves at end very corridor where attack had happened they stopped looked scene was just as it had been that night except that was no stiff cat hanging from torch bracket an empty chair stood against wall bearing message chamber secrets has been opened thats where filch has been keeping guard ron muttered they looked at each other corridor was deserted cant hurt have poke around said harry dropping his bag getting his hands knees so that he could crawl along searching for clues scorch marks he said here here come look at this said hermione this is funny harry got up crossed window next message on wall hermione was pointing at topmost pane where around twenty spiders were scuttling apparently fighting get through small crack long silvery thread was dangling like rope as though they had all climbed it their hurry get outside have you ever seen spiders act like that said hermione wonderingly no said harry have you ron ron he looked over his shoulder ron was standing well back seemed be fighting impulse run whats up said harry dont like spiders said ron tensely never knew that said hermione looking at ron surprise youve used spiders potions loads times 154 dont mind them dead said ron who was carefully looking anywhere but at window

you wouldnt like them either if youd been holding your bear suddenly it had too many legs he broke off shuddering hermione was obviously still trying not laugh feeling they had better get off subject harry said remember all that water on floor where did that come from someones mopped it up it was about here said ron recovering himself walk few paces past filchs chair pointing level with this door he reached for brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though hed been burned whats matter said harry cant go said ron gruffly thats girls toilet oh ron wont be anyone said hermione standing up coming over thats moaning myrtles place come on lets have look ignoring large out order sign she opened door it was gloomiest most depressing bathroom harry had ever set foot under large cracked spotted mirror were row chipped sinks floor was damp reflected dull light given off by stubs few candles burning low their holders wooden doors stalls were flaking scratched one them was dangling off its hinges l 55 hermione put her fingers her lips set off toward end stall when she reached it she said hello myrtle how are you harry ron went look moaning myrtle was floating above tank toilet picking spot on her chin this is girls bathroom she said eyeing ron harry suspiciously theyre not girls no hermione agreed just wanted show them how er nice it is here she waved vaguely at dirty old mirror damp floor ask her if she saw anything harry mouthed at hermione what are you whispering said myrtle staring at him nothing said harry quickly we wanted ask wish people would stop talking

my life was nothing but misery at this place now people come along ruining my death we wanted ask you if youve seen anything funny lately said hermione quickly because cat was attacked right outside your front door on halloween did you see anyone near here that night said harry wasnt paying attention said myrtle dramatically peeves upset me so much came here tried kill myself then course remembered that im that im already dead said ron helpfully il 56 myrtle gave tragic sob rose up air turned over dived headfirst into toilet splashing water all over them vanishing from sight although from direction her muffled sobs she had come rest somewhere ubend harry ron stood with their mouths open but hermione shrugged wearily said honestly that was almost cheerful for myrtle come on lets go harry had barely closed door on myrtles gurgling sobs when loud voice made all three them jump ron percy weasley had stopped dead at head stairs prefect badge agleam an expression complete shock on his face thats girls bathroom he gasped what were you just having look around ron shrugged clues you know percy swelled manner that reminded harry forcefully mrs weasley get away from perry said striding toward them starting bustle them along flapping his arms dont you care what this looks like coming back here while everyones at dinner why shouldnt we be here said ron hotly stopping short glaring at percy listen we never laid finger on that cat thats what told ginny said percy fiercely but she still seems think youre going be expelled ive never seen her so upset crying her eyes out you might think her all first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business you dont care about ginny said ron whose ears were now 157 reddening youre just worried im going mess up your chances being head boy five points from gryffindor percy said tersely fingering his prefect badge hope it teaches you lesson no more detective work or ill write mum he strode off back his neck as red as rons ears harry ron hermione chose seats as far as possible from percy common room that night ron was still very bad temper kept blotting his charms homework when he reached absently for his wand remove smudges it ignited parchment fuming almost as much as his homework ron slammed standard book spells grade 2 shut harrys surprise hermione followed suit who can it be though she said quiet voice as though continuing conversation they had just been having whod want frighten all squibs muggleborns out hogwarts lets think said ron mock puzzlement who do we know who thinks muggleborns are scum he looked at

his fathers definitely evil enough 158 they couldve had key chamber secrets for centuries said ron handing it down father son well said hermione cautiously suppose its possible but how do we prove it

fifty school rules expect if month or so you feel like explaining you will let us know wont you said ron irritably all right said hermione coldly what wed need do is get inside slytherin common room ask malfoy few questions without him realizing its us but thats impossible harry said as ron laughed no its not said hermione all wed need would be some polyjuice potion whats that said ron harry together snape mentioned it class few weeks ago dyou think weve got nothing better do potions than listen snape muttered ron it transforms you into somebody else think about it we could change into three slytherins no one would know it was us malfoy would probably tell us anything hes probably boasting about it slytherin common room right now if only we could hear him this polyjuice stuff sounds bit dodgy me said ron frowning what if we were stuck looking like three slytherins forever it wears off after while said hermione waving her hand 159 impatiently but getting hold recipe will be very difficult snape said it was book called moste potente potions its bound be restricted section library was only one way get out book from restricted section you needed signed note permission from teacher hard see why wed want book really said ron if we werent going try make one potions think said hermione that if we made it sound as though we were just interested theory we might stand chance oh come on no teachers going fall for that said ron theyd have be really thick c hh p t v it t 1 n rogue bludger ince disastrous episode pixies professor lockhart had not brought live creatures class

one class began leave harry returned back room where ron hermione were waiting ready harry muttered wait till everyones gone said hermione nervously all right she approached lockharts desk piece paper clutched tightly her hand harry ron right behind her er professor lockhart hermione stammered wanted get this book out library just for background reading she held out piece paper her hand shaking slightly but thing is its restricted section library so need teacher sign for it im sure it would help me understand what you say gadding with ghouls about slowacting venoms ah gadding with ghouls said lockhart taking note from hermione smiling widely at her possibly my very favorite book you enjoyed it 162 oh yes said hermione eagerly so clever way you trapped that last one with teastrainer well im sure no one will mind me giving best student year little extra help said lockhart warmly he pulled out an enormous peacock quill yes nice isnt it he said misreading revolted look on rons face usually save it for booksignings he scrawled an enormous loopy signature on note handed it back hermione so harry said lockhart while hermione folded note with fumbling fingers slipped it into her bag tomorrows first quidditch match season believe gryffindor against slytherin is it not hear youre useful player was seeker too was asked try for national squad but preferred dedicate my life eradication dark forces still if ever you feel need for little private training dont hesitate ask always happy pass on my expertise less able players harry made an indistinct noise his throat then hurried off after ron hermione dont believe it he said as three them examined signature on note he didnt even look at book we wanted thats because hes brainless git said ron but who cares weve got what we needed he is not brainless git said hermione shrilly as they half ran toward library just because he said you were best student year they dropped their voices as they entered muffled stillness library madam pince librarian was thin irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture 163 moste potente potions she repeated suspiciously trying take note from hermione but hermione wouldnt let go was wondering if could keep it she said breathlessly oh come on said ron wrenching it from her grasp thrusting it at madam pince well get you another autograph lockhartll sign anything if it stands still long enough madam pince held note up light as though determined detect forgery but it passed test she stalked away between lofty shelves returned several minutes later carrying large moldylooking book hermione put it carefully into her bag they left trying not walk too quickly or look too guilty five minutes later they were barricaded moaning myrtles outof order bathroom once again hermione had overridden rons objections by pointing out that it was last place anyone their right minds would go so they were guaranteed some privacy moaning myrtle was crying noisily her stall but they were ignoring her she them hermione opened moste potente potions carefully three them bent over dampspotted pages it was clear from glance why it belonged restricted section some potions had effects almost too gruesome think about were some very unpleasant illustrations which included man who seemed have been turned inside out witch sprouting several extra pairs arms out her head here it is said hermione excitedly as she found page headed polyjuice potion it was decorated with drawings people halfway through transforming into other people harry sin 164 cerely hoped artist had imagined looks intense pain on their faces this is most complicated potion ive ever seen said hermione as they scanned recipe lacewing flies leeches fluxweed knotgrass she murmured running her finger down list ingredients well theyre easy enough theyre student store cupboard we can help ourselves oooh look powdered horn bicorn dont know where were going get that shredded skin boomslang thatll be tricky too course bit whoever we want change into excuse me said ron sharply what dyou mean bit whoever were changing into im drinking nothing with crabbes toenails it hermione continued as though she hadnt heard him we dont have worry about that yet though because we add those bits last ron turned speechless harry who had another worry dyou realize how much were going have steal hermione shredded skin boomslang thats definitely not students cupboard whatre we going do break into snapes private stores dont know if this is good idea hermione shut book with snap well if you two are going chicken out fine she said were bright pink patches on her cheeks her eyes were brighter than usual dont want break rules you know think threatening muggleborns is far worse than brewing up difficult potion but if you dont want find out if its malfoy ill go straight madam pince now hand book back 165 never thought id see day when youd be persuading us break rules said ron all right well do it but not toenails okay how long will it take make anyway said harry as hermione looking happier opened book again well since fluxweed has got be picked at full moon lacewings have got be stewed for twentyone days id say itd be ready about month if we can get all ingredients month said ron malfoy could have attacked half muggle borns school by then but hermiones eyes narrowed dangerously again he added swiftly but its best plan weve got so full steam ahead say however while hermione was checking that coast was clear for them leave bathroom ron muttered harry itll be lot less hassle if you can just knock malfoy off his broom tomorrow harry woke early on saturday morning lay for while thinking about coming quidditch match he was nervous mainly at thought what wood would say if gryffindor lost but also at idea facing team mounted on fastest racing brooms gold could buy he had never wanted beat slytherin so badly after half an hour lying with his insides churning he got up dressed went down breakfast early where he found rest gryffindor team huddled at long empty table all looking uptight not speaking much as eleven oclock approached whole school started make its way down quidditch stadium it was muggy sort day 166 with hint thunder air ron hermione came hurrying over wish harry good luck as he entered locker rooms team pulled on their scarlet gryffindor robes then sat down listen woods usual prematch pep talk slytherin has better brooms than us he began no point denying it but weve got better people on our brooms weve trained harder than they have weve been flying all weathers too true muttered george weasley havent been properly dry since august were going make them rue day they let that little bit slime malfoy buy his way onto their team chest heaving with emotion wood turned harry itll be down you harry show them that seeker has have something more than rich father get that snitch before malfoy or die trying harry because weve got win today weve got so no pressure harry said fred winking at him as they walked out onto pitch roar noise greeted them mainly cheers because ravenclaw hufflepuff were anxious see slytherin beaten but slytherins crowd made their boos hisses heard too madam hooch quidditch teacher asked flint wood shake hands which they did giving each other threatening stares gripping rather harder than was necessary on my whistle said madam hooch three two one with roar from crowd speed them upward fourteen players rose toward leaden sky harry flew higher than any them squinting around for snitch 167 all right scarhead yelled malfoy shooting underneath him as though show off speed his broom harry had no time reply at that very moment heavy black bludger came pelting toward him he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed close one harry said george streaking past him with his club his hand ready knock bludger back toward slytherin harry saw george give bludger powerful whack direction adrian pucey but bludger changed direction midair shot straight for harry again harry dropped quickly avoid it george managed hit it hard toward malfoy once again bludger swerved like boomerang shot at harrys head harry put on burst speed zoomed toward other end pitch he could hear bludger whistling along behind him what was going on bludgers never concentrated on one player like this it was their job try unseat as many people as possible fred weasley was waiting for bludger at other end harry ducked as fred swung at bludger with all his might bludger was knocked off course gotcha fred yelled happily but he was wrong as though it was magnetically attracted harry bludger pelted after him once more harry was forced fly off at full speed it had started rain harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face splattering onto his glasses he didnt have clue what was going on rest game until he heard lee jordan who was commentating say slytherin lead sixty points zero 168 slytherins superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs meanwhile mad bludger was doing all it could knock harry out air fred george were now flying so close him on either side that harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms had no chance look for snitch let alone catch it someones tampered with this bludger fred grunted swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched new attack on harry we need time out said george trying signal wood stop bludger breaking harrys nose at same time wood had obviously got message madam hoochs whistle rang out harry fred george dived for ground still trying avoid mad bludger whats going on said wood as gryffindor team huddled together while slytherins crowd jeered were being flattened fred george where were you when that bludger stopped angelina scoring we were twenty feet above her stopping other bludger from murdering harry oliver said george angrily someones fixed it it wont leave harry alone it hasnt gone for anyone else all game slytherins must have done something it but bludgers have been locked madam hoochs office since our last practice was nothing wrong with them then said wood anxiously madam hooch was walking toward them over her shoulder harry could see slytherin team jeering pointing his direction 169 listen said harry as she came nearer nearer with you two flying around me all time only way im going catch snitch is if it flies up my sleeve go back rest team let me deal with rogue one dont be thick said fred itll take your head off wood was looking from harry weasleys oliver this is insane said alicia spinner angrily you cant let harry deal with that thing on his own lets ask for an inquiry if we stop now well have forfeit match said harry were not losing slytherin just because crazy bludger come on oliver tell them leave me alone this is all your fault george said angrily wood get snitch or die trying what stupid thing tell him madam hooch had joined them ready resume play she asked wood wood looked at determined look on harrys face all right he said fred george you heard harry leave him alone let him deal with bludger on his own rain was falling more heavily now on madam hoochs whistle harry kicked hard into air heard telltale whoosh bludger behind him higher higher harry climbed he looped swooped spiraled zigzagged rolled slightly dizzy he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open rain was speckling his glasses ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down avoiding another fierce dive from bludger he could hear laughter from crowd he knew he must look very stupid but rogue bludger was heavy couldnt change direction as quickly as harry could he began kind rollercoaster ride around 170 edges stadium squinting through silver sheets rain gryffindor goal posts where adrian pucey was trying get past wood whistling harrys ear told him bludger had just missed him again he turned right over sped opposite direction training for ballet potter yelled malfoy as harry was forced do stupid kind twirl midair dodge bludger he fled bludger trailing few feet behind him then glaring back at malfoy hatred he saw it golden snitch it was hovering inches above malfoys left ear malfoy busy laughing at harry hadnt seen it for an agonizing moment harry hung midair not daring speed toward malfoy case he looked up saw snitch wham he had stayed still second too long bludger had hit him at last smashed into his elbow harry felt his arm break dimly dazed by searing pain his arm he slid sideways on his raindrenched broom one knee still crooked over it his right arm dangling useless at his side bludger came pelting back for second attack this time wming at his face harry swerved out way one idea firmly lodged his numb brain get malfoy through haze rain pain he dived for shimmering sneering face below him saw its eyes widen with fear malfoy thought harry was attacking him what he gasped careening out harrys way harry took his remaining hand off his broom made wild snatch he felt his fingers close on cold snitch but was now only 171 gripping broom with his legs was yell from crowd below as he headed straight for ground trying hard not pass out with splattering thud he hit mud rolled off his broom his arm was hanging at very strange angle riddled with pain he heard as though from distance good deal whistling shouting he focused on snitch clutched his good hand aha he said vaguely weve won he fainted he came around rain falling on his face still lying on field with someone leaning over him he saw glitter teeth oh no not you he moaned doesnt know what hes saying said lockhart loudly anxious crowd gryffindors pressing around them not worry harry im about fix your arm nosaid harry ill keep it like this thanks he tried sit up but pain was terrible he heard familiar clicking noise nearby dont want photo this colin he said loudly lie back harry said lockhart soothingly its simple charm ive used countless times why cant just go hospital wing said harry through clenched teeth he should really professor said muddy wood who couldnt help grinning even though his seeker was injured great capture harry really spectacular your best yet id say through thicket legs around him harry spotted fred 112 george weasley wrestling rogue bludger into box it was still putting up terrific fight stand back said lockhart who was rolling up his jadegreen sleeves no dont said harry weakly but lockhart was twirling his wand second later had directed it straight at harrys arm strange unpleasant sensation started at harrys shoulder spread all way down his fingertips it felt as though his arm was being deflated he didnt dare look at what was happening he had shut his eyes his face turned away from his arm but his worst fears were realized as people above him gasped colin creevey began clicking away madly his arm didnt hurt anymore nor did it feel remotely like an arm ah said lockhart yes well that can sometimes happen but point is bones are no longer broken thats thing bear mind so harry just toddle up hospital wing ah mr weasley miss granger would you escort him madam pomfrey will be able er tidy you up bit as harry got his feet he felt strangely lopsided taking deep breath he looked down at his right side what he saw nearly made him pass out again poking out end his robes was what looked like thick flesh colored rubber glove he tried move his fingers nothing happened lockhart hadnt mended harrys bones he had removed them madam pomfrey wasnt at all pleased you should have come straight me she raged holding up 173 sad limp remainder what half an hour before had been working arm can mend bones second but growing them back you will be able wont you said harry desperately ill be able certainly but it will be painful said madam pomfrey grimly throwing harry pair pajamas youll have stay night hermione waited outside curtain drawn around harrys bed while ron helped him into his pajamas it took while stuff rubbery boneless arm into sleeve how can you stick up for lockhart now hermione eh ron called through curtain as he pulled harrys limp fingers through cuff if harry had wanted deboning he would have asked anyone can make mistake said hermione it doesnt hurt anymore does it harry no said harry getting into bed but it doesnt do anything else either as he swung himself onto bed his arm flapped pointlessly hermione madam pomfrey came around curtain madam pomfrey was holding large bottle something labeled skelegro youre for rough night she said pouring out steaming beakerful handing it him regrowing bones is nasty business so was taking skelegro it burned harrys mouth throat as it went down making him cough splutter still tuttutting about dangerous sports inept teachers madam pomfrey re 114 treated leaving ron hermione help harry gulp down some water we won though said ron grin breaking across his face that was some catch you made malfoys face he looked ready kill want know how he fixed that bludger said hermione darkly we can add that list questions well ask him when weve taken polyjuice potion said harry sinking back onto his pillows hope it tastes better than this stuff if its got bits slytherins it youve got be joking said ron door hospital wing burst open at that moment filthy soaking wet rest gryffindor team had arrived see harry unbelievable flying harry said george ive just seen mar cus flint yelling at malfoy something about having snitch on top his head not noticing malfoy didnt seem too happy they had brought cakes sweets bottles pumpkin juice they gathered around harrys bed were just getting started on what promised be good party when madam pomfrey came storming over shouting this boy needs rest hes got thirtythree bones regrow out out harry was left alone with nothing distract him from stabbing pains his limp arm hours hours later harry woke quite suddenly pitch blackness gave small yelp pain his arm now felt full large splinters for second he thought that was what had woken him then with thrill horror he realized that someone was sponging his forehead dark get off he said loudly then dobby houseelfs goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at harry through darkness single tear was running down his long pointed nose harry potter came back school he whispered miserably dobby warned warned harry potter ah sir why didnt you heed dobby why didnt harry potter go back home when he missed train harry heaved himself up on his pillows pushed dobbys sponge away whatre you doing here he said how did you know missed train dobbys lip trembled harry was seized by sudden suspicion it was you he said slowly you stopped

terrible things are happen are perhaps happening already dobby cannot let harry potter stay here now that history is repeat itself now that chamber secrets is open once more dobby froze horrorstruck

ears quivering harry heard it too were footsteps coming down passageway outside dobby must go breathed elf terrified was loud crack harrys fist was suddenly clenched on thin air he slumped back into bed his eyes on dark doorway hospital wing as footsteps drew nearer next moment dumbledore was backing into dormitory wearing long woolly dressing gown nightcap he was carrying one end what looked like statue professor mcgonagall appeared second later carrying its feet together they heaved it onto bed get madam pomfrey whispered dumbledore professor mcgonagall hurried past end harrys bed out sight harry lay quite still pretending be asleep he heard urgent voices then professor mcgonagall swept back into view closely followed by madam pomfrey who was pulling cardigan on over her nightdress he heard sharp intake breath what happened madam pomfrey whispered dumbledore bending over statue on bed l79 another attack said dumbledore minerva found him on stairs was bunch grapes next him said professor mcgonagall we think he was trying sneak up here visit potter harrys stomach gave horrible lurch slowly carefully he raised himself few inches so he could look at statue on bed ray moonlight lay across its staring face it was colin creevey his eyes were wide his hands were stuck up front him holding his camera petrified whispered madam pomfrey yes said professor mcgonagall but shudder think if albus hadnt been on way downstairs for hot chocolate who knows what might have three them stared down at colin then dumbledore leaned forward wrenched camera out colins rigid grip you dont think he managed get picture his attacker said professor mcgonagall eagerly dumbledore didnt answer he opened back camera good gracious said madam pomfrey jet steam had hissed out camera harry three beds away caught acrid smell burnt plastic melted said madam pomfrey wonderingly all melted what does this mean albus professor mcgonagall asked urgently it means said dumbledore that chamber secrets

what harry could see professor mcgonagalls shad owy face she didnt understand this any better than he did c hh p t t r eleven dkjeling clijib harry woke up on sunday morning find dormitory blazing with winter sunlight his arm reboned but very stiff he sat up quickly looked over at colins bed but it had been blocked from view by high curtains harry had changed behind yesterday seeing that he was awake madam pomfrey came bustling over with breakfast tray then began bending stretching his arm fingers all order she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded when youve finished eating you may leave harry dressed as quickly as he could hurried off gryffindor tower desperate tell ron hermione about colin dobby but they werent harry left look for them wondering where they could have got feeling slightly hurt that they werent interested whether he had his bones back or not 182 as harry passed library percy weasley strolled out it looking far better spirits than last time theyd met oh hello harry he said excellent flying yesterday really excellent gryffindor has just taken lead for house cup you earned fifty points you havent seen ron or hermione have you said harry no havent said percy his smile fading hope rons not another girls toilet harry forced laugh watched percy walk out sight then headed straight for moaning myrtles bathroom he couldnt see why ron hermione would be again but after making sure that neither filch nor any prefects were around he opened door heard their voices coming from locked stall its me he said closing door behind him was clunk splash gasp from within stall he saw hermiones eye peering through keyhole harry she said you gave us such fright come hows your arm fine said harry squeezing into stall an old cauldron was perched on toilet crackling from under rim told harry they had lit fire beneath it conjuring up portable waterproof fires was speciality hermiones wedve come meet you but we decided get started on polyjuice potion ron explained as harry with difficulty locked stall again weve decided this is safest place hide it harry started tell them about colin but hermione interrupted we already know we heard professor mcgonagall telling professor flitwick this morning thats why we decided wed better get going sooner we get confession out malfoy better snarled ron dyou know what think he was such foul temper after quidditch match he took it out on colin theres something else said harry watching hermione tearing bundles knotgrass throwing them into potion dobby came visit me middle night ron hermione looked up amazed harry told them everything dobby had told him or hadnt told him hermione ron listened with their mouths open chamber secrets has been opened before hermione said this settles it said ron triumphant voice lucius malfoy mustve opened chamber when he was at school here now hes told dear old draco how do it its obvious wish dobbyd told you what kind monsters though want know how come nobodys noticed it sneaking around school maybe it can make itself invisible said hermione prodding leeches bottom cauldron or maybe it can disguise itself pretend be suit armor or something ive read about chameleon ghouls you read too much hermione said ron pouring dead lacewings on top leeches he crumpled up empty lacewing bag looked at harry so dobby stopped us from getting on train broke your arm he shook his head you know what harry if he doesnt stop trying save your life hes going kill you 184 news that colin creevey had been attacked was now lying as though dead hospital wing had spread through entire school by monday morning air was suddenly thick with rumor suspicion first years were now moving around castle tightknit groups as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone ginny weasley who sat next colin creevey charms was distraught but harry felt that fred george were going wrong way about cheering her up they were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils jumping out at her from behind statues they only stopped when percy apoplectic with rage told them he was going write mrs weasley tell her ginny was having nightmares meanwhile hidden from teachers roaring trade talismans amulets other protective devices was sweeping school neville longbottom bought large evilsmelling green onion pointed purple crystal rotting newt tail before other gryffindor boys pointed out that he was no danger he was pure blood therefore unlikely be attacked they went for filch first neville said his round face fearful everyone knows im almost squib second week december professor mcgonagall came around as usual collecting names those who would be staying at school for christmas harry ron hermione signed her list they had heard that malfoy was staying which struck them as very suspicious holidays would be perfect time use polyjuice potion try worm confession out him unfortunately potion was only half finished they still 385 needed bicorn horn boomslang skin only place they were going get them was from snapes private stores harry privately felt hed rather face slytherins legendary monster than let snape catch him robbing his office what we need said hermione briskly as thursday afternoons double potions lesson loomed nearer is diversion then one us can sneak into snapes office take what we need harry ron looked at her nervously think id better do actual stealing hermione continued matteroffact tone you two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble ive got clean record so all you need do is cause enough mayhem keep snape busy for five minutes or so harry smiled feebly deliberately causing mayhem snapes potions class was about as safe as poking sleeping dragon eye potions lessons took place one large dungeons thursday afternoons lesson proceeded usual way twenty cauldrons stood steaming between wooden desks on which stood brass scales jars ingredients snape prowled through fumes making waspish remarks about gryffindors work while slytherins sniggered appreciatively draco malfoy who was snapes favorite student kept flicking pufferfish eyes at ron harry who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say unfair harrys swelling solution was far too runny but he had his mind on more important things he was waiting for hermiones signal he hardly listened as snape paused sneer at his watery 186 potion when snape turned walked off bully neville hermione caught harrys eye nodded harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron pulled one freds filibuster fireworks out his pocket gave it quick prod with his wand firework began fizz sputter knowing he had only seconds harry straightened up took aim lobbed it into air it landed right on target goyles cauldron goyles potion exploded showering whole class people shrieked as splashes swelling solution hit them malfoy got faceful his nose began swell like balloon goyle blundered around his hands over his eyes which had expanded size dinner plate snape was trying restore calm find out what had happened through confusion harry saw hermione slip quietly into snapes office silence silence snape roared anyone who has been splashed come here for deflating draft when find out who did this harry tried not laugh as he watched malfoy hurry forward his head drooping with weight nose like small melon as half class lumbered up snapes desk some weighted down with arms like clubs others unable talk through gigantic puffedup lips harry saw hermione slide back into dungeon front her robes bulging when everyone had taken swig antidote various swellings had subsided snape swept over goyles cauldron scooped out twisted black remains firework was sudden hush 187 if ever find out who threw this snape whispered shall make sure that person is expelled harry arranged his face into what he hoped was puzzled expression snape was looking right at him bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome he knew it was me harry told ron hermione as they hurried back moaning myrtles bathroom could tell hermione threw new ingredients into cauldron began stir feverishly itll be ready two weeks she said happily snape cant prove it was you said ron reassuringly harry what can he do knowing snape something foul said harry as potion frothed bubbled week later harry ron hermione were walking across entrance hall when they saw small knot people gathered around notice board reading piece parchment that had just been pinned up seamus finnigan dean thomas beckoned them over looking excited theyre starting dueling club said seamus first meeting tonight wouldnt mind dueling lessons they might come handy one these days what you reckon slytherins monster can duel said ron but he too read sign with interest could be useful he said harry hermione as they went into dinner shall we go harry hermione were all for it so at eight oclock that 188 evening they hurried back great hall long dining tables had vanished golden stage had appeared along one wall lit by thousands candles floating overhead ceiling was velvety black once more most school seemed be packed beneath it all carrying their wands looking excited wonder wholl be teaching us said hermione as they edged into chattering crowd someone told me flitwick was dueling champion when he was young maybe itll be him as long as its not harry began but he ended on groan gilderoy lockhart was walking onto stage resplendent robes deep plum accompanied by none other than snape wearing his usual black lockhart waved an arm for silence called gather round gather round can everyone see me can you all hear me excellent now professor dumbledore has granted me permission start this little dueling club train you all case you ever need defend yourselves as myself have done on countless occasions for full details see my published works let me introduce my assistant professor snape said lockhart flashing wide smile he tells me he knows tiny little bit about dueling himself has sportingly agreed help me with short demonstration before we begin now dont want any you youngsters worry youll still have your potions master when im through with him never fear wouldnt it be good if they finished each other off ron muttered harrys ear snapes upper lip was curling harry wondered why lockhart 189 was still smiling if snape had been looking at him like that hed have been running as fast as he could opposite direction lockhart snape turned face each other bowed at least lockhart did with much twirling his hands whereas snape jerked his head irritably then they raised their wands like swords front them as you see we are holding our wands accepted combative position lockhart told silent crowd on count three we will cast our first spells neither us will be aiming kill course wouldnt bet on that harry murmured watching snape baring his teeth one two three both them swung their wands above their heads pointed them at their opponent snape cried expelliarmus was dazzling flash scarlet light lockhart was blasted off his feet he flew backward off stage smashed into wall slid down it sprawl on floor malfoy some other slytherins cheered hermione was dancing on tiptoes do you think hes all right she squealed through her fingers who cares said harry ron together lockhart was getting unsteadily his feet his hat had fallen off his wavy hair was standing on end well you have it he said tottering back onto platform that was disarming charm as you see ive lost my wand ah thank you miss brown yes an excellent idea show them that professor snape but if you dont mind my saying 190 so it was very obvious what you were about do if had wanted stop you it would have been only too easy however felt it would be instructive let them see snape was looking murderous possibly lockhart had noticed because he said enough demonstrating im going come amongst you now put you all into pairs professor snape if youd like help me they moved through crowd matching up partners lockhart teamed neville with justin finchfletchley but snape reached harry ron first time split up dream team think he sneered weasley you

partner miss bulstrode malfoy strutted over smirking behind him walked slytherin girl who reminded harry picture hed seen holidays with hags she was large square her heavy jaw jutted aggressively hermione gave her weak smile that she did not return face your partners called lockhart back on platform bow harry malfoy barely inclined their heads not taking their eyes off each other wands at ready shouted lockhart when count three cast your charms disarm your opponents only disarm them we dont want any accidents one two three 191 harry swung his wand high but malfoy had already started on two his spell hit harry so hard he felt as though hed been hit over head with saucepan he stumbled but everything still seemed be working wasting no more time harry pointed his wand straight at malfoy shouted rictusempra jet silver light hit malfoy stomach he doubled up wheezing said disarm only lockhart shouted alarm over heads battling crowd as malfoy sank his knees harry had hit him with tickling charm he could barely move for laughing harry hung back with vague feeling it would be unsporting bewitch malfoy while he was on floor but this was mistake gasping for breath malfoy pointed his wand at harrys knees choked tarantallegra next second harrys legs began jerk around out his control kind quickstep stop stop screamed lockhart but snape took charge finite incantatem he shouted harrys feet stopped dancing malfoy stopped laughing they were able look up haze greenish smoke was hovering over scene both neville justin were lying on floor panting ron was holding up an ashenfaced seamus apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done but hermione millicent bulstrode were still moving millicent had hermione headlock hermione was whimpering pain both their wands lay forgotten on floor harry leapt forward pulled millicent off it was difficult she was lot bigger than he was dear dear said lockhart skittering through crowd looking at aftermath duels up you go macmillan 192 careful miss fawcett pinch it hard itll stop bleeding second boot think id better teach you how block unfriendly spells said lockhart standing flustered midst hall he glanced at snape whose black eyes glinted looked quickly away lets have volunteer pair longbottom finchfletchley how about you bad idea professor lockhart said snape gliding over like large malevolent bat longbottom causes devastation with simplest spells well be sending whats left finchfletchley up hospital wing matchbox nevilles round pink face went pinker how about malfoy potter said snape with twisted smile excellent idea said lockhart gesturing harry malfoy into middle hall as crowd backed away give them room now harry said lockhart when draco points his wand at you you do this he raised his own wand attempted complicated sort wiggling action dropped it snape smirked as lockhart quickly picked it up saying whoops my wand is little overexcited snape moved closer malfoy bent down whispered something his ear malfoy smirked too harry looked up nervously at lockhart said professor could you show me that blocking thing again scared muttered malfoy so that lockhart couldnt hear him you wish said harry out corner his mouth lockhart cuffed harry merrily on shoulder just do what did harry what drop my wand but lockhart wasnt listening three two one go he shouted malfoy raised his wand quickly bellowed serpensortia end his wand exploded harry watched aghast as long black snake shot out it fell heavily onto floor between them raised itself ready strike were screams as crowd backed swiftly away clearing floor dont move potter said snape lazily clearly enjoying sight harry standing motionless eye eye with angry snake ill get rid it allow me shouted lockhart he brandished his wand at snake was loud bang snake instead vanishing flew ten feet into air fell back floor with loud smack enraged hissing furiously it slithered straight toward justin finchfletchley raised itself again fangs exposed poised strike harry wasnt sure what made him do it he wasnt even aware deciding do it all he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters that he had shouted stupidly at snake leave him alone miraculously inexplicably snake slumped floor docile as thick black garden hose its eyes now on harry harry felt fear drain out him he knew snake wouldnt attack anyone now though how he knew it he couldnt have explained he looked up at justin grinning expecting see justin looking 194 relieved or puzzled or even grateful but certainly not angry scared what do you think youre playing at he shouted before harry could say anything justin had turned stormed out hall snape stepped forward waved his wand snake vanished small puff black smoke snape too was looking at harry an unexpected way it was shrewd calculating look harry didnt like it he was also dimly aware an ominous muttering all around walls then he felt tugging on back his robes come on said rods voice his ear move come on ron steered him out hall hermione hurrying alongside them as they went through doors people on either side drew away as though they were frightened catching something harry didnt have clue what was going on neither ron nor hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all way up empty gryffindor common room then ron pushed harry into an armchair said youre parselmouth why didnt you tell us im what said harry parselmouth said ron you can talk snakes know said harry mean thats only second time ive ever done it accidentally set boa constrictor on my cousin dudley at zoo once long story but it was telling me it had never seen brazil sort set it free without meaning that was before knew was wizard boa constrictor told you it had never seen brazil ron repeated faintly 195 so said harry bet loads people here can do it oh no they cant said ron its not very common gift harry this is bad whats bad said harry starting feel quite angry whats wrong with everyone listen if hadnt told that snake not attack justin oh thats what you said it what dyou mean you were you heard me heard you speaking parseltongue said ron snake language you could have been saying anything no wonder justin panicked you sounded like you were egging snake on or something it was creepy you know harry gaped at him spoke different language but didnt realize how can speak language without knowing can speak it ron shook his head both he hermione were looking as though someone had died harry couldnt see what was so terrible dyou want tell me whats wrong with stopping massive snake biting off justins head he said what does it matter how did it as long as justin doesnt have join headless hunt it matters said hermione speaking at last hushed voice because being able talk snakes was what salazar slytherin was famous for thats why symbol slytherin house is serpent harrys mouth fell open exactly said ron now whole schools going think youre his greatgreatgreatgreatgrandson or something but im not said harry with panic he couldnt quite explain youll find that hard prove said hermione he lived about thousand years ago for all we know you could be il96 harry lay awake for hours that night through gap curtains around his fourposter he watched snow starting drift past tower window wondered could he be descendant salazar slithering he didnt know anything about his fathers family after all dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives quietly harry tried say something parseltongue words wouldnt come it seemed he had be facetoface with snake do it but im gryffindor harry thought sorting hat wouldnt have put me here if had slytherin blood ah said nasty little voice his brain but sorting hat wanted put you slytherin dont you remember harry turned over hed see justin next day herbology hed explain that hed been calling snake off not egging it on which he thought angrily pummeling his pillow any fool should have realized by next morning however snow that had begun night had turned into blizzard so thick that last herbology lesson term was canceled professor sprout wanted fit socks scarves on mandrakes tricky operation she would entrust no one else now that it was so important for mandrakes grow quickly revive mrs norris colin creevey harry fretted about this next fire gryffindor common room while ron hermione used their time off play game wizard chess for heavens sake harry said hermione exasperated as one 197 rons bishops wrestled her knight off his horse dragged him off board go find justin if its so important you so harry got up left through portrait hole wondering where justin might be castle was darker than it usually was daytime because thick swirling gray snow at every window shivering harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place catching snatches what was happening within professor mcgonagall was shouting at someone who by sound it had turned his friend into badger resisting urge take look harry walked on by thinking that justin might be using his free time catch up on some work deciding check library first group hufliepuffs who should have been herbology were indeed sitting at back library but they didnt seem be working between long lines high bookshelves harry could see that their heads were close together they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation he couldnt see whether justin was among them he was walking toward them when something what they were saying met his ears he paused listen hidden invisibility section so anyway stout boy was saying told justin hide up our dormitory mean say if potters marked him down as his next victim its best if he keeps low profile for while course justins been waiting for something like this happen ever since he let slip potter he was muggleborn justin actually told him hed been down for eton thats not kind thing you bandy about with slytherins heir on loose is it you definitely think it is potter then ernie said girl with blonde pigtails anxiously 198 hannah said stout boy solemnly hes parselmouth everyone knows thats mark dark wizard have you ever heard decent one who could talk snakes they called slytherin himself serpenttongue was some heavy murmuring at this ernie went on remember what was written on wall enemies heir beware potter had some sort runin with filch next thing we know flichs cats attacked that first year creevey was annoying potter at quidditch match taking pictures him while he was lying mud next thing we know creeveys been attacked he always seems so nice though said hannah uncertainly well hes one who made youknowwho disappear he cant be all bad can he ernie lowered his voice mysteriously hufflepuffs bent closer harry edged nearer so that he could catch ernies words no one knows how he survived that attack by youknowwho mean say he was only baby when it happened he should have been blasted into smithereens only really powerful dark wizard could have survived curse like that he dropped his voice until it was barely more than whisper said thats probably why you knowwho wanted kill him first place didnt want another dark lord competing with him wonder what other powers potters been hiding harry couldnt take anymore clearing his throat loudly he stepped out from behind bookshelves if he hadnt been feeling so angry he would have found sight that greeted him funny every one hufflepuffs looked as though they had been petrified by sight him color was draining out ernies face 199 hello said harry im looking for justin finchfletchley hufepuffs worst fears had clearly been confirmed they all looked fearfully at ernie what do you want with him said ernie quavering voice wanted tell him what really happened with that snake at dueling club said harry ernie bit his white lips then taking deep breath said we were all we saw what happened then you noticed that after spoke it snake backed off said harry all saw said ernie stubbornly though he was trembling as he spoke was you speaking parseltongue chasing snake toward justin didnt chase it at him harry said his voice shaking with anger it didnt even touch him it was very near miss said ernie case youre getting ideas he added hastily might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations witches warlocks my bloods as pure as anyones so cc dont care what sort blood youve got said harry fiercely why would want attack muggleborns ive heard you hate those muggles you live with said ernie swiftly its not possible live with dursleys not hate them said harry id like see you try it he turned on his heel stormed out library earning himself reproving glare from madam pince who was polishing gilded cover large spellbook 200 harry blundered up corridor barely noticing where he was going he was such fury result was that he walked into something very large solid which knocked him backward onto floor oh hello hagrid harry said looking up hagrids face was entirely hidden by woolly snowcovered balaclava but it couldnt possibly be anyone else as he filled most corridor his moleskin overcoat dead rooster was hanging from one his massive gloved hands all righ harry he said pulling up balaclava so he could speak why arent yeh class canceled said harry getting up whatre you doing here hagrid held up limp rooster second one killed this term he explained its either foxes or bloodsuckin bugbear an need headmasters permission ter put charm around hen coop he peered more closely at harry from under his thick snowflecked eyebrows yeh sure yehre all righ yeh look all hot an bothered harry couldnt bring himself repeat what ernie rest hufflepuffs had been saying about him its nothing he said id better get going hagrid its transfiguration next ive got pick up my books he walked off his mind still full what ernie had said about him justins been waiting for something like this happen ever since he let slip potter he was muggleborn 2 0 il harry stamped up stairs turned along another corridor which was particularly dark torches had been extinguished by strong icy draft that was blowing through loose windowpane he was halfway down passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on floor he turned squint at what hed fallen over felt as though his stomach had dissolved justin finchfletchley was lying on floor rigid cold look shock frozen on his face his eyes staring blankly at ceiling that wasnt all next him was another figure strangest sight harry had ever seen it was nearly headless nick no longer pearlywhite transparent but black smoky floating immobile horizontal six inches off floor his head was half off his face wore an expression shock identical justins harry got his feet his breathing fast shallow his heart doing kind drumroll against his ribs he looked wildly up down deserted corridor saw line spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from bodies only sounds were muffled voices teachers from classes on either side he could run no one would ever know he had been but he couldnt just leave them lying here he had get help would anyone believe he hadnt had anything do with this as he stood panicking door right next him opened with bang peeves poltergeist came shooting out why its potty wee potter cackled peeves knocking harrys glasses askew as he bounced past him whats potter up whys potter lurking 202 peeves stopped halfway through midair somersault upside down he spotted justin nearly headless nick he flipped right way up filled his lungs before harry could stop him screamed attack attack another attack no mortal or ghost is safe run for your lives attaaaack crash crash crash door after door flew open along corridor people flooded out for several long minutes was scene such confusion that justin was danger being squashed people kept standing nearly headless nick harry found himself pinned against wall as teachers shouted for quiet professor mcgonagall came running followed by her own class one whom still had blackandwhitestriped hair she used her wand set off aloud bang which restored silence ordered everyone back into their classes no sooner had scene cleared somewhat than ernie hufflepuff arrived panting on scene caught act ernie yelled his face stark white pointing his finger dramatically at harry that will do macmillan said professor mcgonagall sharply peeves was bobbing overhead now grinning wickedly surveying scene peeves always loved chaos as teachers bent over justin nearly headless nick examining them peeves broke into song oh potter you rotter oh what have you done youre killing off students you think its good fun thats enough peeves barked professor mcgonagall peeves zoomed away backward with his tongue out at harry 203 justin was carried up hospital wing by professor flitwick professor sinistra astronomy department but nobody seemed know what do for nearly headless nick end professor mcgonagall conjured large fan out thin air which she gave ernie with instructions waft nearly headless nick up stairs this ernie did fanning nick along like silent black hovercraft this left harry professor mcgonagall alone together this way potter she said professor said harry at once swear didnt this is out my hands potter said professor mcgonagall curtly they marched silence around corner she stopped before large extremely ugly stone gargoyle lemon drop she said this was evidently password because gargoyle sprang suddenly life hopped aside as wall behind him split two even full dread for what was coming harry couldnt fail be amazed behind wall was spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward like an escalator as he professor mcgonagall stepped onto it harry heard wall thud closed behind them they rose upward circles higher higher until at last slightly dizzy harry saw gleaming oak door ahead with brass knocker shape griffin he knew now where he was being taken this must be where dumbledore lived 204 c i3 p t v rr t w e v polyjuice potion hey stepped off stone staircase at top professor mcgonagall rapped on door it opened silently they entered professor mcgonagall told harry wait left him alone harry looked around one thing was certain all teachers offices harry had visited so far this year dumbledores was by far most interesting if he hadnt been scared out his wits that he was about be thrown out school he would have been very pleased have chance look around it it was large beautiful circular room full funny little noises number curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables whirring emitting little puffs smoke walls were covered with portraits old headmasters headmistresses all whom were snoozing gently their frames was also an enormous clawfooted desk sitting on shelf behind it shabby tattered wizards hat sorting hat 205 harry hesitated he cast wary eye around sleeping witches wizards on walls surely it couldnt hurt if he took hat down tried it on again just see just make sure it had put him right house he walked quietly around desk lifted hat from its shelf lowered it slowly onto his head it was much too large slipped down over his eyes just as it had done last time hed put it on harry stared at black inside hat waiting then small voice said his ear bee your bonnet harry potter er yes harry muttered er sorry bother you wanted ask youve been wondering whether put you right house said hat smartly yes you were particularly difficult place but stand by what said before harrys heart leapt you would have done well slytherin harrys stomach plummeted he grabbed point hat pulled it off it hung limply his hand grubby faded harry pushed it back onto its shelf feeling sick youre wrong he said aloud still silent hat it didnt move harry backed away watching it then strange gagging noise behind him made him wheel around he wasnt alone after all standing on golden perch behind door was decrepitlooking bird that resembled halfplucked turkey harry stared at it bird looked balefully back making its gagging noise again harry thought it looked very ill its eyes were dull even as harry watched couple more feathers fell out its tail harry was just thinking that all he needed was for dumbledores pet bird die while he was alone office with it when bird burst into flames harry yelled shock backed away into desk he looked feverishly around case was glass water somewhere but couldnt see one bird meanwhile had become fireball it gave one loud shriek next second was nothing but smouldering pile ash on floor office door opened dumbledore came looking very somber professor harry gasped your bird couldnt do anything he just caught fire harrys astonishment dumbledore smiled about time too he said hes been looking dreadful for days ive been telling him get move on he chuckled at stunned look on harrys face fawkes is phoenix harry phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them die are reborn from ashes watch him harry looked down time see tiny wrinkled newborn bird poke its head out ashes it was quite as ugly as old one its shame you had see him on burning day said dumbledore seating himself behind his desk hes really very handsome most time wonderful red gold plumage fascinating creatures phoenixes they can carry immensely heavy loads their tears have healing powers they make highly faithful pets shock fawkes catching fire harry had forgotten what he was for but it all came back him as dumbledore settled himself high chair behind desk fixed harry with his penetrating lightblue stare before dumbledore could speak another word however door office flew open with an almighty bang hagrid burst wild look his eyes his balaclava perched on top his shaggy black head dead rooster still swinging from his hand it wasn harry professor dumbledore said hagrid urgently was talkin ter him seconds before that kid was found he never had time sir dumbledore tried say something but hagrid went ranting on waving rooster around his agitation sending feathers everywhere it cantve bin him ill swear it front o ministry o magic if have hagrid yehve got wrong boy sir know harry never hagrid said dumbledore loudly do not think that harry attacked those people oh said hagrid rooster falling limply at his side right ill wait outside then headmaster he stomped out looking embarrassed you dont think it was me professor harry repeated hopefully as dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk no harry dont said dumbledore though his face was somber again but still want talk you harry waited nervously while dumbledore considered him tips his long fingers together 208 must ask you harry whether is anything youd like tell me he said gently anything at all harry didnt know what say he thought malfoy shouting youll be next mudbloods polyjuice potion simmering away moaning myrtles bathroom then he thought disembodied voice he had heard twice remembered what ron had said hearing voices no one else can hear isnt good sign even wizarding world he thought too about what everyone was saying about him his growing dread that he was somehow connected with salazar slytherin no said harry isnt anything professor double attack on justin nearly headless nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic curiously it was nearly headless nicks fate that seemed worry people most what could possibly do that ghost people asked each other what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead was almost stampede book seats on hogwarts express so that students could go home for christmas at this rate well be only ones left ron told harry hermione us malfoy crabbe goyle what jolly holiday its going be crabbe goyle who always did whatever malfoy did had signed up stay over holidays too but harry was glad that most people were leaving he was tired people skirting around him corridors as though he was about sprout fangs or spit poison tired all muttering pointing hissing as he passed 209 fred george however found all this very funny they went out their way march ahead harry down corridors shouting make way for heir slytherin seriously evil wizard coming through percy was deeply disapproving this behavior it is not laughing matter he said coldly oh get out way percy said fred harrys hurry yeah hes off chamber secrets for cup tea with his fanged servant said george chortling ginny didnt find it amusing either oh dont she wailed every time fred asked harry loudly who he was planning attack next or when george pretended ward harry off with large clove garlic when they met harry didnt mind it made him feel better that fred george at least thought idea his being slytherins heir was quite ludicrous but their antics seemed be aggravating draco malfoy who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it its because hes bursting say its really him said ron knowingly you know how he hates anyone beating him at anything youre getting all credit for his dirty work not for long said hermione satisfied tone polyjuice potions nearly ready well be getting truth out him any day now at last term ended silence deep as snow on grounds descended on castle harry found it peaceful rather than gloomy enjoyed fact that he hermione weasleys had run gryffindor tower which meant they could 210 play exploding snap loudly without bothering anyone practice dueling private fred george ginny had chosen stay at school rather than visit bill egypt with mr mrs weasley percy who disapproved what he termed their childish behavior didnt spend much time gryffindor common room he had already told them pompously that he was only staying over christmas because it was his duty as prefect support teachers during this troubled time christmas morning dawned cold white harry ron only ones left their dormitory were woken very early by hermione who burst fully dressed carrying presents for them both wake up she said loudly pulling back curtains at window hermione youre not supposed be here said ron shielding his eyes against light merry christmas you too said hermione throwing him his present ive been up for nearly an hour adding more lacewings potion its ready harry sat up suddenly wide awake are you sure positive said hermione shifting scabbers rat so that she could sit down on end rons fourposter if were going do it say it should be tonight at that moment hedwig swooped into room carrying very small package her beak hello said harry happily as she landed on his bed are you speaking me again 211 she nibbled his ear an affectionate sort way which was far better present than one that she had brought him which turned out be from dursleys they had sent harry toothpick note telling him find out whether hed be able stay at hogwarts for summer vacation too rest harrys christmas presents were far more satisfactory hagrid had sent him large tin treacle fudge which harry decided soften by fire before eating ron had given him book called flying with cannons book interesting facts about his favorite quidditch team hermione had bought him luxury eaglefeather quill harry opened last present find new handknitted sweater from mrs weasley large plum cake he read her card with fresh surge guilt thinking about mr weasleys car which hadnt been seen since its crash with whomping willow bout rulebreaking he ron were planning next no one not even someone dreading taking polyjuice potion later could fail enjoy christmas dinner at hogwarts great hall looked magnificent not only were dozen frostcovered christmas trees thick streamers holly mistletoe crisscrossing ceiling but enchanted snow was falling warm dry from ceiling dumbledore led them few his favorite carols hagrid booming more more loudly with every goblet eggnog he consumed percy who hadnt noticed that fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read pinhead kept asking them all what they were sniggering at harry didnt even care that draco malfoy was making loud snide remarks 2l2 about his new sweater from slytherin table with bit luck malfoy would be getting his comeuppance few hours time harry ron had barely finished their third helpings christmas pudding when hermione ushered them out hall finalize their plans for evening we still need bit people youre changing into said hermione matteroffacdy as though she were sending them supermarket for laundry detergent obviously itll be best if you can get something crabbes goyles theyre malfoys best friends hell tell them anything we also need make sure real crabbe goyle cant burst on us while were interrogating him ive got it all worked out she went on smoothly ignoring harrys rons stupefied faces she held up two plump chocolate cakes ive filled these with simple sleeping draught all you have do is make sure crabbe goyle find them you know how greedy they are theyre bound eat them once theyre asleep pull out few their hairs hide them broom closet harry ron looked incredulously at each other hermione dont think that could go seriously wrong but hermione had steely glint her eye not unlike one professor mcgonagall sometimes had potion will be useless without crabbes goyles hair she said sternly you do want investigate malfoy dont you oh all right all right said harry but what about you whose hair are you ripping out 213 ive already got mine said hermione brightly pulling tiny bottle out her pocket showing them single hair inside it remember millicent bulstrode wrestling with me at dueling club she left this on my robes when she was trying strangle me shes gone home for christmas so ill just have tell slytherins ive decided come back when hermione had bustled off check on polyjuice potion again ron turned harry with doomladen expression have you ever heard plan where so many things could go wrong but harrys rons utter amazement stage one operation went just as smoothly as hermione had said they lurked deserted entrance hall after christmas tea waiting for crabbe goyle who had remained alone at slytherin table shoveling down fourth helpings trifle harry had perched chocolate cakes on end banisters when they spotted crabbe goyle coming out great hall harry ron hid quickly behind suit armor next front door how thick can you get ron whispered ecstatically as crabbe gleefully pointed out cakes goyle grabbed them grinning stupidly they stuffed cakes whole into their large mouths for moment both them chewed greedily looks triumph on their faces then without smallest change expression they both keeled over backward onto floor by far hardest part was hiding them closet across hall once they were safely stowed among buckets mops harry yanked out couple bristles that covered goyles fore 2 14 head ron pulled out several crabbes hairs they also stole their shoes because their own were far too small for crabbe goylesize feet then still stunned at what they had just done they sprinted up moaning myrtles bathroom they could hardly see for thick black smoke issuing from stall which hermione was stirring cauldron pulling their robes up over their faces harry ron knocked softly on door hermione they heard scrape lock hermione emerged shiny faced looking anxious behind her they heard gloop gloop bubbling glutinous potion three glass tumblers stood ready on toilet seat did you get them hermione asked breathlessly harry showed her goyles hair good sneaked these spare robes out laundry hermione said holding up small sack youll need bigger sizes once youre crabbe goyle three them stared into cauldron close up potion looked like thick dark mud bubbling sluggishly im sure ive done everything right said hermione nervously rereading splotched page moste potente potions it looks like book says it should once weve drunk it well have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves now what ron whispered we separate it into three glasses add hairs hermione ladled large dollops potion into each glasses then her hand trembling she shook millicent bulstrodes hair out its bottle into first glass 215 potion hissed loudly like boiling kettle frothed madly second later it had turned sick sort yellow urgh essence millicent bulstrode said ron eyeing it with loathing bet it tastes disgusting add yours then said hermione harry dropped goyles hair into middle glass ron put crabbes into last one both glasses hissed frothed goyles turned khaki color booger crabbes dark murky brown hang on said harry as ron hermione reached for their glasses wed better not all drink them here once we turn into crabbe goyle we wont fit millicent bulstrodes no pixie good thinking said ron unlocking door well take separate stalls careful not spill drop his polyjuice potion harry slipped into middle stall ready he called ready came rons hermiones voices one two three pinching his nose harry drank potion down two large gulps it tasted like overcooked cabbage immediately his insides started writhing as though hed just swallowed live snakes doubled up he wondered whether he was going be sick then burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach very ends his fingers toes next bringing him gasping all fours came horrible melting feeling as skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax before his eyes his hands began grow fingers thickened nails broadened 2116 knuckles were bulging like bolts his shoulders stretched painfully prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows his robes ripped as his chest expanded like barrel bursting its hoops his feet were agony shoes four sizes too small as suddenly as it had started everything stopped harry lay facedown on stonecold floor listening myrtle gurgling morosely end toilet with difficulty he kicked off his shoes stood up so this was what it felt like being goyle his large hand trembling he pulled off his old robes which were hanging foot above his ankles pulled on spare ones laced up goyles boatlike shoes he reached up brush his hair out his eyes met only short growth wiry bristles low on his forehead then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because goyle obviously didnt need them he took them off called are you two okay goyles low rasp voice issued from his mouth yeah came deep grunt crabbe from his right harry unlocked his door stepped front cracked mirror goyle stared back at him out dull deepset eyes harry scratched his ear so did goyle rons door opened they stared at each other except that he looked pale shocked ron was indistinguishable from crabbe from puddingbowl haircut long gorilla arms this is unbelievable said ron approaching mirror prodding crabbes flat nose unbelievable wed better get going said harry loosening watch that was cutting into goyles thick wrist weve still got find out 217 where slytherin common room is only hope we can find someone follow ron who had been gazing at harry said you dont know how bizarre it is see goyle thinking he banged on hermiones door cmon we need go highpitched voice answered him dont think

that harry muttered ron eh crabbe holds them sort stiff hows this yeah thats better they went down marble staircase all they needed now was 218 slytherin that they could follow slytherin common room but was nobody around any ideas muttered harry slytherins always come up breakfast from over said ron nodding at entrance dungeons words had barely left his mouth when girl with long curly hair emerged from entrance excuse me said ron hurrying up her weve forgotten way our common room beg your pardon said girl stiffly our common room im ravenclaw she walked away looking suspiciously back at them harry ron hurried down stone steps into darkness their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as crabbes goyles huge feet hit floor feeling that this wasnt going be as easy as they had hoped labyrinthine passages were deserted they walked deeper deeper under school constantly checking their watches see how much time they had left after quarter an hour just when they were getting desperate they heard sudden movement ahead ha said ron excitedly theres one them now figure was emerging from side room as they hurried nearer however their hearts sank it wasnt slytherin it was percy whatre you doing down here said ron surprise percy looked affronted that he said stiffly is none your business its crabbe isnt it 2 19 wh oh yeah said ron well get off your dormitories said percy sternly its

passage that peter weasley percy ron corrected him automatically whatever said malfoy ive noticed him sneaking around lot lately bet know what hes up he thinks hes going catch slytherins heir singlehanded he gave short derisive laugh harry ron exchanged excited looks malfoy paused by stretch bare damp stone wall 220 whats new password again he said harry er said harry oh yeah pureblood said malfoy not listening stone door concealed wall slid open malfoy marched through it harry ron followed him slytherin common room was long low underground room with rough stone walls ceiling from which round greenish lamps were hanging on chains fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead them several slytherins were silhouetted around it highbacked chairs wait here said malfoy harry ron motioning them pair empty chairs set back from fire ill go get it my fathers just sent it me wondering what malfoy was going show them harry ron sat down doing their best look at home malfoy came back minute later holding what looked like newspaper clipping he thrust it under rons nose thatll give you laugh he said harry saw rons eyes widen shock he read clipping quickly gave very forced laugh handed it harry it had been clipped out daily prophet it said inquiry at ministry magic arthur weasley head misuse muggle artifacts office was today fined fifty galleons for bewitching

disrepute mr malfoy told our reporter he is clearly unfit draw up our laws his ridiculous muggle protection act should be scrapped immediately mr weasley was unavailable for comment although his wife told reporters clear off or shed set family ghoul on them well said malfoy impatiently as harry handed clipping back him dont you think its funny ha ha said harry bleakly arthur weasley loves muggles so much he should snap his wand half go join them said malfoy scornfully youd never know weasleys were purebloods way they behave rons or rather crabbes face was contorted with fury whats up with you crabbe snapped malfoy stomachache ron grunted well go up hospital wing give all those mudbloods kick from me said malfoy snickering you know im surprised daily prophet hasnt reported all these attacks yet he went on thoughtfully suppose dumbledores trying hush it all up hell be sacked if it doesnt stop soon fathers always said old dumbledores worst thing thats ever happened this place he loves muggleborns decent headmaster would neverve let slime like that creevey 222 malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera did cruel but accurate impression colin potter can have your picture potter can have your autograph can lick your shoes please potter he dropped his hands looked at harry ron whats matter with you two far too late harry ron forced themselves laugh but malfoy seemed satisfied perhaps crabbe goyle were always slow on uptake saint potter mudbloods friend said malfoy slowly hes another one with no proper wizard feeling or he wouldnt go around with that jumped up granger mudblood people think hes slytherins heir harry ron waited with bated breath malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him but then wish knew who it is said malfoy petulantly could help them rons jaw dropped so that crabbe looked even more clueless than usual fortunately malfoy didnt notice harry thinking fast said you must have some idea whos behind it all you know havent goyle how many times do have tell you snapped malfoy father wont tell me anything about last time chamber was opened either course it was fifty years ago so it was before his time but he knows all about it he says that it was all kept quiet itll look suspicious if know too much about it but know one thing last time chamber secrets was opened mudblood died so bet its matter time before one thems killed this time hope its granger he said with relish ron was clenching crabbes gigantic fists feeling that it would be bit giveaway if ron punched malfoy harry shot him warning look said dyou know if person who opened chamber last time was caught oh yeah whoever it was was expelled said malfoy theyre probably still azkaban azkaban said harry puzzled azkaban wizard prison goyle said malfoy looking at him disbelief honestly if you were any slower youd be going backward he shifted restlessly his chair said father says keep my head down let heir slytherin get on with it he says school needs ridding all mudblood filth but not get mixed up it course hes got lot on his plate at moment you know ministry magic raided our manor last week harry tried force goyles dull face into look concern yeah said malfoy luckily they didnt find much fathers got some very valuable dark arts stuff but luckily weve got our own secret chamber under drawingroom floor ho said ron malfoy looked at him so did harry ron blushed even his hair was turning red his nose was also slowly lengthening their hour was up ron was turning back into himself from look horror he was suddenly giving harry he must be too they both jumped their feet medicine for my stomach ron grunted without further ado they sprinted length slytherin common room hurled themselves at stone wall dashed up passage hoping against hope that malfoy hadnt noticed anything harry 224 could feel his feet slipping around goyles huge shoes had hoist up his robes as he shrank they crashed up steps into dark entrance hall which was full muffled pounding coming from closet where theyd locked crabbe goyle leaving their shoes outside closet door they sprinted their socks up marble staircase toward moaning myrtles bathroom well it wasnt complete waste time ron panted closing bathroom door behind them know we still havent found out whos doing attacks but im going write dad tomorrow tell him check under malfoys drawing room harry checked his face cracked mirror he was back normal he put his glasses on as ron hammered on door hermiones stall hermione come out weve got loads tell you go away hermione squeaked harry ron looked at each other whats matter said ron you must be back normal by now we are but moaning myrtle glided suddenly through stall door harry had never seen her looking so happy ooooooh wait till you see she said its awful they heard lock slide back hermione emerged sobbing her robes pulled up over her head whats up said ron uncertainly have you still got millicents nose or something hermione let her robes fall ron backed into sink her face was covered black fur her eyes had turned yellow were long pointed ears poking through her hair it was ccat hair she howled mmillicent bulstrode 225 mmust have cat ppotion isnt supposed be used for animal transformations uhoh said ron youll be teased something dreadful said myrtle happily its okay hermione said harry quickly well take you up hospital wing madam pomfrey never asks too many questions it took long time persuade hermione leave bathroom moaning myrtle sped them on their way with hearty guffaw wait till everyone finds out youve got tail ermione remained hospital wing for several weeks was flurry rumor about her disappearance when rest school arrived back from their christmas holidays because course everyone thought that she had been attacked so many students filed past hospital wing trying catch glimpse her that madam pomfrey took out her curtains again placed them around hermiones bed spare her shame being seen with furry face harry ron went visit her every evening when new term started they brought her each days homework if id sprouted whiskers id take break from work said ron tipping stack books onto hermiones bedside table one evening dont be silly ron ive got keep up said hermione briskly her spirits were greatly improved by fact that all hair had 21 gone from her face her eyes were turning slowly back brown dont suppose youve got any new leads she added whisper so that madam pomfrey couldnt hear her nothing said harry gloomily was so sure it was malfoy said ron for about hundredth time whats that asked harry pointing something gold sticking out from under hermiones pillow just get well card said hermione hastily trying poke it out sight but ron was too quick for her he pulled it out flicked it open read aloud miss granger wishing you speedy recovery from your concerned teacher professor gilderoy lockhart order merlin third class honorary member dark force defense league fivetime winner witch weeklys most charmingsmile award ron looked up at hermione disgusted you sleep with this under your pillow but hermione was spared answering by madam pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose medicine is lockhart smarmiest bloke youve ever met or what ron said harry as they left infirmary started up stairs toward gryffindor tower snape had given them so much homework harry thought he was likely be sixth year before he finished it ron was just saying he wished he had asked hermione how many rat tails you were supposed add hairraising potion when an angry outburst from floor above reached their ears thats filch harry muttered as they hurried up stairs paused out sight listening hard 228 you dont think someone elses been attacked said ron tensely they stood still their heads inclined toward flichs voice which sounded quite hysterical even more work for me mopping all night like havent got enough do no this is final straw im going dumbledore his footsteps receded along outofsight corridor they heard distant door slam they poked their heads around corner filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post they were once again on spot where mrs norris had been attacked they saw at glance what filch had been shouting about great flood water stretched over half corridor it looked as though it was still seeping from under door moaning myrtles bathroom now that filch had stopped shouting they could hear myrtles wails echoing off bathroom walls now whats up with her said ron lets go see said harry holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through great wash water door bearing its out order sign ignored it as always entered moaning myrtle was crying if possible louder harder than ever before she seemed be hiding down her usual toilet it was dark bathroom because candles had been extinguished great rush water that had left both walls floor soaking wet whats up myrtle said harry whos that glugged myrtle miserably come throw something else at me harry waded across her stall said why would throw something at you 229 dont ask me myrtle shouted emerging with wave yet more water which splashed onto already sopping floor here am minding my own business someone thinks its funny throw book at me but it cant hurt you if someone throws something at you said harry reasonably mean itd just go right through you wouldnt it he had said wrong thing myrtle puffed herself up shrieked lets all throw books at myrtle because she cant feel it ten points if you can get it through her stomach fifty points if it goes through her head well ha ha ha what lovely game dont think who threw it at you anyway asked harry dont know was just sitting ubend thinking about death it fell right through top my head said myrtle glaring at them its over it got washed out harry ron looked under sink where myrtle was pointing small thin book lay it had shabby black cover was as wet as everything else bathroom harry stepped forward pick it up but ron suddenly flung out an arm hold him back what said harry are you crazy said ron it could be dangerous dangeroussaid harry laughing come off it how could it be dangerous youd be surprised said ron who was looking apprehensively at book some books ministrys confiscated dads told me was one that burned your eyes out 20 everyone who read sonnets sorcerer spoke limericks for rest their lives some old witch bath had book that you could never stop reading you just had wander around with your nose it trying do everything onehanded all right ive got point said harry little book lay on floor nondescript soggy well we wont find out unless we look at it he said he ducked around ron picked it up off floor harry saw at once that it was diary faded year on cover told him it was fifty years old he opened it eagerly on first page he could just make out name t m riddle smudged ink hang on said ron who had approached cautiously was looking over harrys shoulder know that name t m riddle got an award for special services school fifty years ago how on earth dyou know that said harry amazement because filch made me polish his shield about fifty times detention said ron resentfully that was one burped slugs all over if youd wiped slime off name for an hour youd remember it too harry peeled wet pages apart they were completely blank wasnt faintest trace writing on any them not even auntie mabels birthday or dentist halfpast three he never wrote it said harry disappointed wonder why someone wanted flush it away said ron curiously harry turned back cover book saw printed name variety store on vauxhall road london 231 he mustve been muggleborn said harry thoughtfufly have bought diary from vauxhall road well its not much use you said ron he dropped his voice fifty points if you can get it through myrtles nose harry however pocketed it hermione left hospital wing dewhiskered tailless furfree at beginning february on her first evening back gryffindor tower harry showed her t m riddles diary told her story how they had found it oooh it might have hidden powers said hermione enthusiastically taking diary looking at it closely if it has its hiding them very well said ron maybe its shy dont know why you dont chuck it harry wish knew why someone did try chuck it said harry wouldnt mind knowing how riddle got an award for special services hogwarts either couldve been anything said ron maybe he got thirty owls or saved teacher from giant squid maybe he murdered myrtle that wouldve done everyone favor but harry could tell from arrested look on hermiones face that she was thinking what he was thinking what said ron looking from one other well chamber secrets was opened fifty years ago wasnt it he said thats what malfoy said yeah said ron slowly this diary is fifty years old said hermione tapping it excitedly 232 so oh ron wake up snapped hermione we know person who opened chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago we know t m riddle got an award for special services school fifty years ago well what if riddle got his special award for catching heir slytherin his diary would probably tell us everything where chamber is how open it what sort creature lives it person whos behind attacks this time wouldnt want that lying around would they thats brilliant theory hermione said ron with just one tiny little flaw theres nothing written his diary but hermione was pulling her wand out her bag it might be invisible ink she whispered she tapped diary three times said aparecium nothing happened undaunted hermione shoved her hand back into her bag pulled out what appeared be bright red eraser its revealer got it diagon alley she said she rubbed hard on january first nothing happened im telling you theres nothing find said ron riddle just got diary for christmas couldnt be bothered filling it harry couldnt explain even himself why he didnt just throw riddles diary away fact was that even though he knew diary was blank he kept absentmindedly picking it up turning pages as though it were story he wanted finish while harry was sure he had never heard name t m riddle before it still seemed mean something him almost as though 233 riddle was friend hed had when he was very small had halfforgotten but this was absurd hed never had friends before hogwarts dudley had made sure that nevertheless harry was determined find out more about riddle so next day at break he headed for trophy room examine riddles special award accompanied by an interested hermione thoroughly unconvinced ron who told them hed seen enough trophy room last him lifetime riddles burnished gold shield was tucked away corner cabinet it didnt carry details why it had been given him good thing too or itd be even bigger id still be polishing it said ron however they did find riddles name on an old medal for magical merit on list old head boys he sounds like percy said ron wrinkling his nose disgust prefect head boy probably top every class you say that like its bad thing said hermione slightly hurt voice sun had now begun shine weakly on hogwarts again inside castle mood had grown more hopeful had been no more attacks since those on justin nearly headless nick madam pomfrey was pleased report that mandrakes were becoming moody secretive meaning that they were fast leaving childhood moment their acne clears up theyll be ready for repotting again harry heard her telling filch kindly one afternoon after that it wont be long until were cutting them up stewing them youll have mrs norris back no time 243 perhaps heir slytherin had lost his or her nerve thought harry it must be getting riskier riskier open chamber secrets with school so alert suspicious perhaps monster whatever it was was even now settling itself down hibernate for another fifty years ernie macmillan hufflepuff didnt take this cheerful view he was still convinced that harry was guilty one that he had given himself away at dueling club peeves wasnt helping matters he kept popping up crowded corridors singing oh potter you rotter now with dance routine match gilderoy lockhart seemed think he himself had made attacks stop harry overheard him telling professor mcgonagall so while gryffindors were lining up for transfiguration dont think therell be any more trouble minerva he said tapping his nose knowingly winking think chamber has been locked for good this time culprit must have known it was only matter time before caught him rather sensible stop now before came down hard on him you know what school needs now is moralebooster wash away memories last term wont say any more just now but think know just thing he tapped his nose again strode off lockharts idea moralebooster became clear at breakfast time on february fourteenth harry hadnt had much sleep because late running quidditch practice night before he hurried down great hall slightly late he thought for moment that hed walked through wrong doors walls were all covered with large lurid pink flowers worse 235 still heartshaped confetti was falling from pale blue ceiling harry went over gryffindor table where ron was sitting looking sickened hermione seemed have been overcome with giggles whats going on harry asked them sitting down wiping confetti off his bacon ron pointed teachers table apparently too disgusted speak lockhart wearing lurid pink robes match decorations was waving for silence teachers on either side him were looking stonyfaced from where he sat harry could see muscle going professor mcgonagalls cheek snape looked as though someone had just fed him large beaker skelegro happy valentines day lockhart shouted may thank fortysix people who have so far sent me cards yes have taken liberty arranging this little surprise for you all it doesnt end here lockhart clapped his hands through doors entrance hall marched dozen surlylooking dwarfs not just any dwarfs however lockhart had them all wearing golden wings carrying harps my friendly cardcarrying cupids

suddenly became very interested searching her bag for her schedule didnt answer all day long dwarfs kept barging into their classes deliver valentines annoyance teachers late that afternoon as gryffindors were walking upstairs for charms one dwarfs caught up with harry oy you arty potter shouted particularly grimlooking dwarf elbowing people out way get harry hot all over at thought being given valentine front line first years which happened include ginny weasley harry tried escape dwarf however cut his way through crowd by kicking peoples shins reached him before hed gone two paces ive got musical message deliver arry potter person he said twanging his harp threatening sort way not here harry hissed trying escape stay still grunted dwarf grabbing hold harrys bag pulling him back let me go harry snarled tugging with loud ripping noise his bag split two his books wand parchment quill spilled onto floor his ink bottle smashed over everything harry scrambled around trying pick it all up before dwarf started singing causing something holdup corridor 237 whats going on here came cold drawling voice draco malfoy harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag desperate get away before malfoy could hear his musical valentine whats all this commotion said another familiar voice as percy weasley arrived losing his head harry tried make run for it but dwarf seized him around knees brought him crashing floor right he said sitting on harrys ankles here is your singing valentine his eyes are as green as fresh pickled toad his hair is as dark as blackboard wish he was mine hes really divine hero who conquered dark lord harry would have given all gold gringotts evaporate on spot trying valiantly laugh along with everyone else he got up his feet numb from weight dwarf as percy weasley did his best disperse crowd some whom were crying with mirth off you go off you go bell rang five minutes ago off class now he said shooing some younger students away you malfoy harry glancing over saw malfoy stoop snatch up something leering he showed it crabbe goyle harry realized that hed got riddles diary give that back said harry quietly wonder what potters written this said malfoy who obvi 238 ously hadnt noticed year on cover thought he had harrys own diary hush fell over onlookers ginny was staring from diary harry looking terrified hand it over malfoy said percy sternly when ive had look said malfoy waving diary tauntingly at harry percy said as school prefect but harry had lost his temper he pulled out his wand shouted expelliarmus just as snape had disarmed lockhart so malfoy found diary shooting out his hand into air ron grinning broadly caught it harry said percy loudly no magic corridors ill have report this you know but harry didnt care he was oneup on malfoy that was worth five points from gryffindor any day malfoy was looking furious as ginny passed him enter her classroom he yelled spitefully after her dont think potter liked your valentine much ginny covered her face with her hands ran into class snarling ron pulled out his wand too but harry pulled him away ron didnt need spend whole charms belching slugs it wasnt until they had reached professor flitwicks class that harry noticed something rather odd about riddles diary all his other books were drenched scarlet ink diary however was as clean as it had been before ink bottle had smashed all over it he tried point this out ron but ron was having trouble with his wand again large purple bubbles were blossoming out end he wasnt much interested anything else harry went bed before anyone else his dormitory that night this was partly because he didnt think he could stand fred george singing his eyes are as green as fresh pickled toad one more time partly because he wanted examine riddles diary again knew that ron thought he was wasting his time harry sat on his fourposter flicked through blank pages not one which had trace scarlet ink on it then he pulled new bottle out his bedside cabinet dipped his quill into it dropped blot onto first page diary ink shone brightly on paper for second then as though it was being sucked into page vanished excited harry loaded up his quill second time wrote my name is harry potter words shone momentarily on page they too sank without trace then at last something happened oozing back out page his very own ink came words harry had never written hello harry potter my name is tom riddle how did you come by my diary these words too faded away but not before harry had started scribble back someone tried flush it down toilet he waited eagerly for riddles reply lucky that recorded my memories some more lasting way than ink but always knew that would be those who would not want this diary read what do you mean harry scrawled blotting page his excitement 240 mean that this diary holds memories terrible things things that were covered up things that happened at hogwarts school witchcraft wizardry thats where am now harry wrote quickly im at hogwarts horrible stuffs been happening do you know anything about chamber secrets his heart was hammering riddles reply came quickly his writing becoming untidier as though he was hurrying tell all he knew course know about chamber secrets my day they told us it was legend that it did not exist but this was lie my fifth year chamber was opened monster attacked several students finally killing one caught person whod opened chamber he was expelled but headmaster professor dippet ashamed that such thing had happened at hogwarts forbade me tell truth story was given out that thegirl had died freak accident they gave me nice shiny engraved trophy for my trouble warned me keep my mouth shut but knew it could happen again monster lived on one who had power release it was not imprisoned harry nearly upset his ink bottle his hurry write back its happening again now have been three attacks no one seems know whos behind them who was it last time can show you if you like came riddles reply you dont have take my word for it can take you inside my memory night when caught him harry hesitated his quill suspended over diary what did riddle mean how could he be taken inside somebody elses memory he glanced nervously at door dormitory which was 241 growing dark when he looked back at diary he saw fresh words forming let me show you harry paused for fraction second then wrote two letters 40k55 pages diary began blow as though caught high wind stopping halfway through month june mouth hanging open harry saw that little square for june thirteenth seemed have turned into miniscule television screen his hands trembling slightly he raised book press his eye against little window before he knew what was happening he was tilting forward window was widening he felt his body leave his bed he was pitched headfirst through opening page into whirl color shadow he felt his feet hit solid ground stood shaking as blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus he knew immediately where he was this circular room with sleeping portraits was dumbledores office but it wasnt dumbledore who was sitting behind desk wizened fraillooking wizard bald except for few wisps white hair was reading letter by candlelight harry had never seen this man before im sorry he said shakily didnt mean butt but wizard didnt look up he continued read frowning slightly harry drew nearer his desk stammered er ill just go shall still wizard ignored him he didnt seem even have heard him thinking that wizard might be deaf harry raised his voice 242 sorry disturbed you ill go now he halfshouted wizard folded up letter with sigh stood up walked past harry without glancing at him went draw curtains at his window sky outside window was rubyred it seemed be sunset wizard went back desk sat down twiddled his thumbs watching door harry looked around office no fawkes phoenix no whirring silver contraptions this was hogwarts as riddle had known it meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster not dumbledore he harry was little more than phantom completely invisible people fifty years ago was knock on office door enter said old wizard feeble voice boy about sixteen entered taking off his pointed hat silver prefects badge was glinting on his chest he was much taller than harry but he too had jetblack hair ah riddle said headmaster you wanted see me professor dippet said riddle he looked nervous sit down said dippet ive just been reading letter you sent me oh said riddle he sat down gripping his hands together very tightly my dear boy said dipper kindly cannot possibly let you stay at school over summer surely you want go home for holidays no said riddle at once id much rather stay at hogwarts than go back that that 243 you live muggle orphanage during holidays believe said dippet curiously yes sir said riddle reddening slightly you are muggleborn halfblood sir said riddle muggle father witch mother are both your parents my mother died just after was born sir they told me at orphanage she lived just long enough name me tom after my father marvolo after my grandfather dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically thing is tom he sighed special arrangements might have been made for you but current circumstances you mean all these attacks sir said riddle harrys heart leapt he moved closer scared missing anything precisely said headmaster my dear boy you must see how foolish it would be me allow you remain at castle when term ends particularly light recent tragedy death that poor little girl you will be safer by far at your orphanage as matter fact ministry magic is even now talking about closing school we are no nearer locating er source all this unpleasantness riddles eyes had widened sir if person was caught if it all stopped what do you mean said dippet with squeak his voice sitting up his chair riddle do you mean you know something about these attacks no sir said riddle quickly but harry was sure it was same sort no that he himself had given dumbledore 244 dippet sank back looking faintly disappointed you may go tom riddle slid off his chair slouched out room harry followed him down moving spiral staircase they went emerging next gargoyle darkening corridor riddle stopped so did harry watching him harry could tell that riddle was doing some serious thinking he was biting his lip his forehead furrowed then as though he had suddenly reached decision he hurried off harry gliding noiselessly behind him they didnt see another person until they reached entrance hall when tall wizard with long sweeping auburn hair beard called riddle from marble staircase what are you doing wandering around this late tom harry gaped at wizard he was none other than fiftyyear younger dumbledore had see headmaster sir said riddle well hurry off bed said dumbledore giving riddle exactly kind penetrating stare harry knew so well best not roam corridors these days not since he sighed heavily bade riddle good night strode off riddle watched him walk out sight then moving quickly headed straight down stone steps dungeons with harry hot pursuit but harrys disappointment riddle led him not into hidden passageway or secret tunnel but very dungeon which harry had potions with snape torches hadnt been lit when riddle pushed door almost closed harry could only just 2 45 see him standing stockstill by door watching passage outside it felt harry that they were for at least an hour all he could see was figure riddle at door staring through crack waiting like statue just when harry had stopped feeling expectant tense started wishing he could return present he heard something move beyond door someone was creeping along passage he heard whoever it was pass dungeon where he riddle were hidden riddle quiet as shadow edged through door followed harry tiptoeing behind him forgetting that he couldnt be heard for perhaps five minutes they followed footsteps until riddle stopped suddenly his head inclined direction new noises harry heard door creak open then someone speaking hoarse whisper cmon gotta get yeh outta here cmon now box was something familiar about that voice riddle suddenly jumped around corner harry stepped out behind him he could see dark outline huge boy who was crouching front an open door very large box next it evening rubeus said riddle sharply boy slammed door shut stood up what yer doin down here tom riddle stepped closer its all over he said im going have turn you rubeus theyre talking about closing hogwarts if attacks dont stop 4 6 n at dyeh dont think you meant kill anyone but monsters dont make good pets suppose you just let it out for exercise it never killed no one said large boy backing against closed door from behind him harry could hear funny rustling clicking come on rubeus said riddle moving yet closer dead girls parents will be here tomorrow least hogwarts can do is make sure that thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered it wasnt him roared boy his voice echoing dark passage he wouldn he never stand aside said riddle drawing out his wand his spell lit corridor with sudden flaming light door behind large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into wall opposite out it came something that made harry let out long piercing scream unheard by anyone vast lowslung hairy body tangle black legs gleam many eyes pair razorsharp pincers riddle raised his wand again but he was too late thing bowled him over as it scuttled away tearing up corridor out sight riddle scrambled his feet looking after it he raised his wand but huge boy leapt on him seized his wand threw him back down yelling no000000 scene whirled darkness became complete harry felt himself falling with crash he landed spreadeagled on his fourposter gryffindor dormitory riddles diary lying open on his stomach 24 7 before he had had time regain his breath dormitory door opened ron came you are he said harry sat up he was sweating shaking whats up said ron looking at him with concern it was hagrid ron hagrid opened chamber secrets fifty years ago harry ron hermione had always known that hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large monstrous creatures during their first year at hogwarts he had tried raise dragon his little wooden house it would be long time before they forgot giant three headed dog hed christened fluffy if as boy hagrid had heard that monster was hidden somewhere castle harry was sure hed have gone any lengths for glimpse it hed probably thought it was shame that monster had been cooped up so long thought it deserved chance stretch its many legs harry could just imagine thirteenyearold hagrid trying fit leash collar on it but he was equally certain that hagrid would never have meant kill anybody harry half wished he hadnt found out how work riddles diary again again ron hermione made him recount what hed seen until he was heartily sick telling them sick long circular conversations that followed riddle might have got wrong person said hermione maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people how many monsters dyou think this place can hold ron asked dully we always knew hagrid had been expelled said harry miserably attacks mustve stopped after hagrid was kicked out otherwise riddle wouldnt have got his award ron tried different tack riddle does sound like percy who asked him squeal on hagrid anyway but monster had killed someone ron said hermione riddle was going go back some muggle orphanage if they closed hogwarts said harry dont blame him for wanting stay here you met hagrid down knockturn alley didnt you harry he was buying flesheating slug repellent said harry quickly three them fell silent after long pause hermione voiced knottiest question all hesitant voice do you think we should go ask hagrid about it all thatd be cheerful visit said ron hello hagrid tell us have you been setting anything mad hairy loose castle lately end they decided that they would not say anything hagrid unless was another attack as more more days went by with no whisper from disembodied voice they became hopeful that they would never need talk him about why he had been expelled it was now nearly four months since justin nearly headless nick had been petrified nearly everybody seemed think that attacker whoever it was had retired for good peeves had finally got bored his oh potter you rotter song ernie macmillan asked harry quite politely pass bucket leaping toadstools herbology one day march several mandrakes threw loud raucous party greenhouse three this made professor sprout very happy moment they start trying move into each others pots well know theyre fully mature she told harry then well be able revive those poor people hospital wing second years were given something new think about during their easter holidays time had come choose their subjects for third year matter that hermione at least took very seriously it could affect our whole future she told harry ron as they pored over lists new subjects marking them with checks just want give up potions said harry we cant said ron gloomily we keep all our old subjects or idve ditched defense against dark arts but thats very important said hermione shocked not way lockhart teaches it said ron havent learned anything from him except not set pixies loose neville longbottom had been sent letters from all witches wizards his family all giving him different advice on what choose confused worried he sat reading subject lists with his tongue poking out asking people whether they thought arithmancy sounded more difficult than study ancient runes dean thomas who like harry had grown up with muggles ended up closing his eyes jabbing his wand at list then picking subjects it landed on hermione took nobodys advice but signed up for everything harry smiled grimly himself at thought what uncle vernon aunt petunia would say if he tried discuss his career wizardry with them not that he didnt get any guidance percy weasley was eager share his experience depends where you want go harry he said its never too early think about future so id recommend divination people say muggle studies is soft option but personally think wizards should have thorough understanding nonmagical community particularly if theyre thinking working close contact with them look at my father he has deal with muggle business all time my brother charlie was always more an outdoor type so he went for care magical creatures play your strengths harry but only thing harry felt he was really good at was quidditch end he chose same new subjects as ron feeling that if he was lousy at them at least hed have someone friendly help him gryffindors next quidditch match would be against hufflepuff wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner so that harry barely had time for anything but quidditch homework however training sessions were getting better or at least drier evening before saturdays match he went up his dormitory drop off his broomstick feeling gryffindors chances for quidditch cup had never been better but his cheerful mood didnt last long at top stairs dormitory he met neville longbottom who was looking frantic harry dont know who did it just found watching harry fearfully neville pushed open door contents harrys trunk had been thrown everywhere his cloak lay ripped on floor bedclothes had been pulled off his fourposter drawer had been pulled out his bedside cabinet contents strewn over mattress harry walked over bed openmouthed treading on few loose pages travels with trolls as he neville pulled blankets back onto his bed ron dean seamus came dean swore loudly what happened harry no idea said harry but ron was examining harrys robes all pockets were hanging out someones been looking for something said ron is anything missing harry started pick up all his things throw them into his trunk it was only as he threw last lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasnt riddles diarys gone he said an undertone ron what harry jerked his head toward dormitory door ron followed him out they hurried down gryffindor common room which was halfempty joined hermione who was sitting alone reading book called ancient runes made easy hermione looked aghast at news but only gryffindor could have stolen nobody else knows our password exactly said harry they woke next day brilliant sunshine light refreshing breeze perfect quidditch conditions said wood enthusiastically at gryffindor table loading teams plates with scrambled eggs harry buck up you need decent breakfast harry had been staring down packed gryffindor table wondering if new owner riddles diary was right front his eyes hermione had been urging him report robbery but harry didnt like idea hed have tell teacher all about diary how many people knew why hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago he didnt want be one who brought it all up again as he left great hall with ron hermione go collect his quidditch things another very serious worry was added harrys growing list he had just set foot on marble staircase when he heard it yet again kill this time let me rip tear he shouted aloud ron hermione both jumped away from him alarm voice said harry looking over his shoulder just heard it again didnt you ron shook his head wideeyed hermione however clapped hand her forehead harry think ive just understood something ive got go library she sprinted away up stairs what does she understand said harry distractedly still looking around trying tell where voice had come from loads more than do said ron shaking his head but whys she got go library because thats what hermione does said ron shrugging when doubt go library harry stood irresolute trying catch voice again but people were now emerging from great hall behind him talking loudly exiting through front doors on their way quidditch pitch youd better get moving said ron its nearly eleven match harry raced up gryffindor tower collected his nimbus two thousand joined large crowd swarming across grounds but his mind was still castle along with bodiless voice as he pulled on his scarlet robes locker room his only comfort was that everyone was now outside watch game teams walked onto field tumultuous applause oliver wood took off for warmup flight around goal posts madam hooch released balls hufflepuffs who played canary yellow were standing huddle having lastminute discussion tactics harry was just mounting his broom when professor mcgonagall came half marching half running across pitch carrying an enormous purple megaphone harrys heart dropped like stone this match has been cancelled professor mcgonagall called through megaphone addressing packed stadium were boos shouts oliver wood looking devastated landed ran toward professor mcgonagall without getting off his broomstick but professor he shouted weve got play cup gryffindor professor mcgonagall ignored him continued shout through her megaphone all students are make their way back house common rooms where their heads houses will give them further information as quickly as you can please then she lowered megaphone beckoned harry over her potter think youd better come with me wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time harry saw ron detach himself from complaining crowd he came running up them as they set off toward castle harrys surprise professor mcgonagall didnt object yes perhaps youd better come too weasley some students swarming around them were grumbling about match being canceled others looked worried harry ron followed professor mcgonagall back into school up marble staircase but they werent taken anybodys office this time this will be bit shock said professor mcgonagall surprisingly gentle voice as they approached infirmary has been another attack another double attack harrys insides did horrible somersault professor mcgonagall pushed door open he ron entered madam pomfrey was bending over fifthyear girl with long curly hair harry recognized her as ravenclaw theyd accidentally asked for directions slytherin common room on bed next her was hermione ron groaned hermione lay utterly still her eyes open glassy they were found near library said professor mcgonagall dont suppose either you can explain this it was on floor next them she was holding up small circular mirror harry ron shook their heads both staring at hermione will escort you back gryffindor tower said professor mcgonagall heavily need address students any case all students will return their house common rooms by six oclock evening no student is leave dormitories after that time you will be escorted each lesson by teacher no student is use bathroom unaccompanied by teacher all further quidditch training matches are be postponed will be no more evening activities gryffindors packed inside common room listened professor mcgonagall silence she rolled up parchment from which she had been reading said somewhat choked voice need hardly add that have rarely been so distressed it is likely that school will be closed unless culprit behind these attacks is caught would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them come forward she climbed somewhat awkwardly out portrait hole gryffindors began talking immediately thats two gryffindors down not counting gryffindor ghost one ravenclaw one hufflepuff said weasley twins friend lee jordan counting on his fingers havent any teachers noticed that slytherins are all safe isnt it obvious all this stuffs coming from slytherin heir slytherin monster slytherin why dont they just chuck all slytherins out he roared nods scattered applause percy weasley was sitting chair behind lee but for once he didnt seem keen make his views heard he was looking pale stunned percys shock george told harry quietly that ravenclaw girl penelope clearwater shes prefect dont think he thought monster would dare attack prefect but harry was only halflistening he didnt seem be able get rid picture hermione lying on hospital bed as though carved out stone if culprit wasnt caught soon he was looking at lifetime back with dursleys tom riddle had turned hagrid because he was faced with prospect muggle orphanage if school closed harry now knew exactly how he had felt whatre we going do said ron quietly harrys ear dyou think they suspect hagrid weve got go talk him said harry making up his mind cant believe its him this time but if he set monster loose last time hell know how get inside chamber secrets thats start but mcgonagall said weve got stay our tower unless were class think said harry more quietly still its time get my dads old cloak out again harry had inherited ust one thing from his father long sil very invisibility cloak it was their only chance sneaking out school visit hagrid without anyone knowing about it they went bed at usual time waited until neville dean sea mus had stopped discussing chamber secrets finally fallen asleep then got up dressed again threw cloak over themselves journey through dark deserted castle corridors wasnt enjoyable harry who had wandered castle at night sev eral times before had never seen it so crowded after sunset teach ers prefects ghosts were marching corridors pairs staring around for any unusual activity their invisibility cloak didnt stop them making any noise was particularly tense moment when ron stubbed his toe only yards from spot where snape stood standing guard thankfully snape sneezed at almost exactly moment ron swore it was with relief that they reached oak front doors eased them open it was clear starry night they hurried toward lit windows hagrids house pulled off cloak only when they were right outside his front door seconds after they had knocked hagrid flung it open they found themselves facetoface with him aiming crossbow at them fang boarhound barked loudly behind him oh he said lowering weapon staring at them whatre you two doin here whats that for said harry pointing at crossbow as they stepped inside nothin nothin hagrid muttered ive bin expectin doesn matter sit down ill make tea he hardly seemed know what he was doing he nearly extinguished fire spilling water from kettle on it then smashed teapot with nervous jerk his massive hand are you okay hagrid said harry did you hear about hermione oh heard all righ said hagrid slight break his voice he kept glancing nervously at windows he poured them both large mugs boiling water he had forgotten add tea bags was just putting slab fruitcake on plate when was loud knock on door hagrid dropped fruitcake harry ron exchanged panicstricken looks then threw invisibility cloak back over themselves retreated into corner hagrid checked that they were hidden seized his crossbow flung open his door once more good evening hagrid it was dumbledore he entered looking deadly serious was followed by second very oddlooking man stranger had rumpled gray hair an anxious expression was wearing strange mixture clothes pinstriped suit scarlet tie long black cloak pointed purple boots under his arm he carried limegreen bowler thats dads boss ron breathed cornelius fudge minister magic harry elbowed ron hard make him shut up hagrid had gone pale sweaty he dropped into one his chairs looked from dumbledore cornelius fudge bad business hagrid said fudge rather clipped tones very bad business had come four attacks on muggleborns thingsve gone far enough ministrys got act never said hagrid looking imploringly at dumbledore you know never professor dumbledore sir want it understood cornelius that hagrid has my full confidence said dumbledore frowning at fudge look albus said fudge uncomfortably hagrids records against him ministrys got do something school governors have been touch yet again cornelius tell you that taking hagrid away will not help slightest said dumbledore his blue eyes were full fire harry had never seen before look at it from my point view said fudge fidgeting with his bowler im under lot pressure got be seen be doing something if it turns out it wasnt hagrid hell be back no more said but ive got take him got wouldnt be doing my duty take me said hagrid who was trembling take me where for short stretch only said fudge not meeting hagrids eyes not punishment hagrid more precaution if someone else is caught youll be let out with full apology not azkaban croaked hagrid before fudge could answer was another loud rap on door dumbledore answered it it was harrys turn for an elbow ribs hed let out an audible gasp mr lucius malfoy strode into hagrids hut swathed long black traveling cloak smiling cold satisfied smile fang started growl already here fudge he said approvingly good good whatre you doin here said hagrid furiously get outta my house my dear man please believe me have no pleasure at all being inside your er dyou call this house said lucius malfoy sneering as he looked around small cabin simply called at school was told that headmaster was here what exactly did you want with me lucius said dumbledore he spoke politely but fire was still blazing his blue eyes dreadful thing dumbledore said malfoy lazily taking out long roll parchment but governors feel its time for you step aside this is an order suspension youll find all twelve signatures on it im afraid we feel youre losing your touch how many attacks have been now two more this afternoon wasnt it at this rate therell be no muggleborns left at hogwarts we all know what an awful loss that would be school oh now see here lucius said fudge looking alarmed dumbledore suspended no no last thing we want just now 262 appointment or suspension headmaster is matter for governors fudge said mr malfoy smoothly as dumbledore has failed stop these attacks see here malfoy if dumbledore cant stop them said fudge whose upper lip was sweating now mean say who can that remains be seen said mr malfoy with nasty smile but as all twelve us have voted hagrid leapt his feet his shaggy black head grazing ceiling an how many did yeh have ter threaten an blackmail before they agreed malfoy eh he roared dear dear you know that temper yours will lead you into trouble one these days hagrid said mr malfoy would advise you not shout at azkaban guards like that they wont like it at all yeh can take dumbledore yelled hagrid making fang boarhound cower whimper his basket take him away an muggleborns won stand chance therell be killin next calm yourself hagrid said dumbledore sharply he looked at lucius malfoy if governors want my removal lucius shall course step aside but stuttered fudge nogrowled hagrid dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off lucius malfoys cold gray ones however said dumbledore speaking very slowly clearly so that none them could miss word you will find that will 26 ummer was creeping over grounds around castle sky lake alike turned periwinkle blue flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom greenhouses but with no hagrid visible from castle windows striding grounds with fang at his heels scene didnt look right harry no better fact than inside castle where things were so horribly wrong harry ron had tried visit hermione but visitors were now barred from hospital wing were taking no more chances madam pomfrey told them severely through crack infirmary door no im sorry theres every chance attacker might come back finish these people off with dumbledore gone fear had spread as never before so that sun warming castle walls outside seemed stop at mullioned windows was barely face be seen school 265 that didnt look worried tense any laughter that rang through corridors sounded shrill unnatural was quickly stifled harry constantly repeated dumbledores final words himself will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal me help will always be given at hogwarts those who ask for it but what good were these words who exactly were they supposed ask for help when everyone was just as confused scared as they were hagrids hint about spiders was far easier understand trouble was didnt seem be single spider left castle follow harry looked everywhere he went helped rather reluctantly by ron they were hampered course by fact that they werent allowed wander off on their own but had move around castle pack with other gryffindors most their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class class by teachers but harry found it very irksome one person however seemed be thoroughly enjoying atmosphere terror suspicion draco malfoy was strutting around school as though he had just been appointed head boy harry didnt realize what he was so pleased about until potions lesson about two weeks after dumbledore hagrid had left when sitting right behind malfoy harry overheard him gloating crabbe goyle always thought father might be one who got rid dumbledore he said not troubling keep his voice down told you he thinks dumbledores worst headmaster schools ever 266 had maybe well get decent headmaster now someone who wont want chamber secrets closed mcgonagall wont last long shes only filling snape swept past harry making no comment about hermiones empty seat cauldron sir said malfoy loudly sir why dont you apply for headmasters job now now malfoy said snape though he couldnt suppress thin lipped smile professor dumbledore has only been suspended by governors daresay hell be back with us soon enough yeah right said malfoy smirking expect youd have fathers vote sir if you wanted apply for job ill tell father youre best teacher here sir snape smirked as he swept off around dungeon fortunately not spotting seamus finnigan who was pretending vomit into his cauldron im quite surprised mudbloods havent all packed their bags by now malfoy went on bet you five galleons next one dies pity it wasnt granger bell rang at that moment which was lucky at malfoys last words ron had leapt off his stool scramble collect bags books his attempts reach malfoy went unnoticed let me at him ron growled as harry dean hung onto his arms dont care dont need my wand im going kill him with my bare hands hurry up ive got take you all herbology barked snape over classs heads off they marched with harry ron dean bringing up rear ron still trying get loose it was only 261 safe let go him when snape had seen them out castle they were making their way across vegetable patch toward greenhouses herbology class was very subdued were now two missing from their number justin hermione professor sprout set them all work pruning abyssinian shrivelfigs harry went tip an armful withered stalks onto compost heap found himself facetoface with ernie macmillan ernie took deep breath said very formally just want say harry that im sorry ever suspected you know youd never attack hermione granger apologize for all stuff said were all same boat now well he held out pudgy hand harry shook it ernie his friend hannah came work at same shrivelfig as harry ron that draco malfoy character said ernie breaking off dead twigs he seems very pleased about all this doesnt he dyou know think he might be slytherins heir thats clever you said ron who didnt seem have forgiven ernie as readily as harry do you think its malfoy harry ernie asked no said harry so firmly that ernie hannah stared second later harry spotted something several large spiders were scuttling over ground on other side glass moving an unnaturally straight line as though taking shortest route prearranged meeting harry hit ron over hand with his pruning shears ouch whatre you 268 harry pointed out spiders following their progress with his eyes screwed up against sun oh yeah said ron trying failing look pleased but we cant follow them now ernie hannah were listening curiously harrys eyes narrowed as he focused on spiders if they pursued their fixed course could be no doubt about where they would end up looks like theyre heading for forbidden forest ron looked even unhappier about that at end lesson professor sprout escorted class their defense against dark arts lesson harry ron lagged behind others so they could talk out earshot well have use invisibility cloak again harry told ron we can take fang with us hes used going into forest with hagrid he might be some help right said ron who was twirling his wand nervously his fingers er arent arent supposed be werewolves forest he added as they took their usual places at back lockharts classroom preferring not answer that question harry said are good things too centaurs are all right unicorns ron had never been into forbidden forest before harry had entered it only once had hoped never do so again lockhart bounded into room class stared at him every other teacher place was looking grimmer than usual but lockhart appeared nothing short buoyant 2 69 come now he cried beaming around him why all these long faces people swapped exasperated looks but nobody answered dont you people realize said lockhart speaking slowly as though they were all bit dim danger has passed culprit has been taken away says who said dean thomas loudly my dear young man minister magic wouldnt have taken hagrid if he hadnt been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty said lockhart tone someone explaining that one one made two oh yes he would said ron even more loudly than dean flatter myself know touch more about hagrids arrest than you do mr weasley said lockhart selfsatisfied tone ron started say that he didnt think so somehow but stopped midsentence when harry kicked him hard under desk we werent remember harry muttered but lockharts disgusting cheeriness his hints that he had always thought hagrid was no good his confidence that whole business was now at an end irritated harry so much that he yearned throw gadding with ghouls right lockharts stupid face instead he contented himself with scrawling note ron lets do it tonight ron read message swallowed hard looked sideways at empty seat usually filled by hermione sight seemed stiffen his resolve he nodded gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days because from six oclock onward gryffindors had no 270 where else go they also had plenty talk about with result that common room often didnt empty until past midnight harry went get invisibility cloak out his trunk right after dinner spent evening sitting on it waiting for room clear fred george challenged harry ron few games exploding snap ginny sat watching them very subdued hermiones usual chair harry ron kept losing on purpose trying finish games quickly but even so it was well past midnight when fred george ginny finally went bed harry ron waited for distant sounds two dormitory doors closing before seizing cloak throwing it over themselves climbing through portrait hole it was another difficult journey through castle dodging all teachers at last they reached entrance hall slid back lock on oak front doors squeezed between them trying stop any creaking stepped out into moonlit grounds course said ron abruptly as they strode across black grass we might get forest find theres nothing follow those spiders might notve been going at all know it looked like they were moving that sort general direction but his voice trailed away hopefully they reached hagrids house sad sorrylooking with its blank windows when harry pushed door open fang went mad with joy at sight them worried he might wake everyone at castle with his deep booming barks they hastily fed him treacle fudge from tin on mantelpiece which glued his teeth together harry left invisibility cloak on hagrids table would be no need for it pitchdark forest 21l cmon fang were going for walk said harry patting his leg fang bounded happily out house behind them dashed edge forest lifted his leg against large sycamore tree harry took out his wand murmured lumos tiny light appeared at end it just enough let them watch path for signs spiders good thinking said ron id light mine too but you know itd probably blow up or something harry tapped ron on shoulder pointing at grass two solitary spiders were hurrying away from wandlight into shade trees okay ron sighed as though resigned worst im ready lets go so with fang scampering around them sniffing tree roots leaves they entered forest by glow harrys wand they followed steady trickle spiders moving along path they walked behind them for about twenty minutes not speaking listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs rustling leaves then when trees had become thicker than ever so that stars overhead were no longer visible harrys wand shone alone sea dark they saw their spider guides leaving path harry paused trying see where spiders were going but everything outside his little sphere light was pitchblack he had never been this deep into forest before he could vividly remember hagrid advising him not leave forest path last time hed been here but hagrid was miles away now probably sitting cell azkaban he had also said follow spiders 2v2 something wet touched harrys hand he jumped backward crushing rods foot but it was only fangs nose what dyou reckon harry said ron whose eyes he could just make out reflecting light from his wand weve come this far said ron so they followed darting shadows spiders into trees they couldnt move very quickly now were tree roots stumps their way barely visible near blackness harry could feel fangs hot breath on his hand more than once they had stop so that harry could crouch down find spiders wandlight they walked for what seemed like at least half an hour their robes snagging on lowslung branches brambles after while they noticed that ground seemed be sloping downward though trees were as thick as ever then fang suddenly let loose great echoing bark making both harry ron jump out their skins what said ron loudly looking around into pitchdark gripping harrys elbow very hard theres something moving over harry breathed listen sounds like something big they listened some distance their right something big was snapping branches as it carved path through trees oh no said ron oh no oh no oh shut up said harry frantically itll hear you hear me said ron an unnaturally high voice its already heard fang darkness seemed be pressing on their eyeballs as they 273 stood terrified waiting was strange rumbling noise then silence what dyou think its doing said harry probably getting ready pounce said ron they waited shivering hardly daring move dyou think its gone harry whispered dunno then their right came sudden blaze light so bright darkness that both them flung up their hands shield their eyes fang yelped tried run but got lodged tangle thorns yelped even louder harry ron shouted his voice breaking with relief harry its our car what come on harry blundered after ron toward light stumbling tripping moment later they had emerged into clearing mr weasleys car was standing empty middle circle thick trees under roof dense branches its headlights ablaze as ron walked openmouthed toward it it moved slowly toward him exactly like large turquoise dog greeting its owner its been here all time said ron delightedly walking around car look at it forests turned it wild sides car were scratched smeared with mud apparently it had taken trundling around forest on its own fang didnt seem at all keen on it he kept close harry who could feel him quivering his breathing slowing down again harry stuffed his wand back into his robes 214 we thought it was going attack us said ron leaning against car patting it wondered where it had gone harry squinted around on floodlit ground for signs more spiders but they had all scuttled away from glare headlights weve lost trail he said cmon lets go find them ron didnt speak he didnt move his eyes were fixed on point some ten feet above forest floor right behind harry his face was livid with terror harry didnt even have time turn around was loud clicking noise suddenly he felt something long hairy seize him around middle lift him off ground so that he was hanging facedown struggling terrified he heard more clicking saw rons legs leave ground too heard fang whimpering howling next moment he was being swept away into dark trees head hanging harry saw that what had hold him was marching on six immensely long hairy legs front two clutching him tightly below pair shining black pincers behind him he could hear another creatures no doubt carrying ron they were moving into very heart forest harry could hear fang fighting free himself from third monster whining loudly but harry couldnt have yelled even if he had wanted he seemed have left his voice back with car clearing he never knew how long he was creatures clutches he only knew that darkness suddenly lifted enough for him see that leafstrewn ground was now swarming with spiders craning his neck sideways he realized that they had reached ridge 21 vast hollow hollow that had been cleared trees so that stars shone brightly onto worst scene he had ever laid eyes on spiders not tiny spiders like those surging over leaves below spiders size carthorses eighteyed eightlegged black hairy gigantic massive specimen that was carrying harry made its way down steep slope toward misty domed web very center hollow while its fellows closed all around it clicking their pincers excitedly at sight its load harry fell ground on all fours as spider released him ron fang thudded down next him fang wasnt howling anymore but cowering silently on spot ron looked exactly like harry felt his mouth was stretched wide kind silent scream his eyes were popping harry suddenly realized that spider that had dropped him was saying something it had been hard tell because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke aragog it called aragog from middle misty domed web spider size small elephant emerged very slowly was gray black his body legs each eyes on his ugly pincered head was milky white he was blind what is it he said clicking his pincers rapidly men clicked spider who had caught harry is it hagrid said aragog moving closer his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely strangers clicked spider who had brought ron kill them clicked aragog fretfully was sleeping were friends hagrids harry shouted his heart seemed have left his chest pound his throat 216 click click click went pincers spiders all around hollow aragog paused hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he said slowly hagrids trouble said harry breathing very fast thats why weve come trouble said aged spider harry thought he heard concern beneath clicking pincers but why has he sent you harry thought getting his feet but decided against it he didnt think his legs would support him so he spoke from ground as calmly as he could they think up at school that hagrids been setting something on students theyve taken him azkaban aragog clicked his pincers furiously all around hollow sound was echoed by crowd spiders it was like applause except applause didnt usually make harry feel sick with fear but that was years ago said aragog fretfully years years ago remember it well thats why they made him leave school they believed that was monster that dwells what they call chamber secrets they thought that hagrid had opened chamber set me free you you didnt come from chamber secrets said harry who could feel cold sweat on his forehead said aragog clicking angrily was not born castle come from distant land traveler gave me hagrid when was an egg hagrid was only boy but he cared for me hidden cupboard castle feeding me on scraps from table hagrid 2y is my good friend good man when was discovered blamed for death girl he protected me have lived here forest ever since where hagrid still visits me he even found me wife mosag you see how our family has grown all through hagrids goodness harry summoned what remained his courage so you never never attacked anyone never croaked old spider it would have been my instinct but out respect for hagrid never harmed human body girl who was killed was discovered bathroom never saw any part castle but cupboard which grew up our kind like dark quiet but then do you know what did kill that girl said harry because whatever it is its back attacking people again his words were drowned by loud outbreak clicking rustling many long legs shifting angrily large black shapes shifted all around him thing that lives castle said aragog is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others well do remember how pleaded with hagrid let me go when sensed beast moving about school what is it said harry urgently more loud clicking more rustling spiders seemed be closing we do not speak it said aragog fiercely we do not name it never even told hagrid name that dread creature though he asked me many times harry didnt want press subject not with spiders 2v8 pressing closer on all sides aragog seemed be tired tamng he was backing slowly into his domed web but his fellow spiders continued inch slowly toward harry ron well just go then harry called desperately aragog hearing leaves rustling behind him go said aragog slowly think not but but my sons daughters do not harm hagrid on my command but cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst goodbye friend hagrid harry spun around feet away towering above him was solid wall spiders clicking their many eyes gleaming their ugly black heads even as he reached for his wand harry knew it was no good were too many them but as he tried stand ready die fighting loud long note sounded blaze light flamed through hollow mr weasleys car was thundering down slope headlights glaring its horn screeching knocking spiders aside several were thrown onto their backs their endless legs waving air car screeched halt front harry ron doors flew open get fang harry yelled diving into front seat ron seized boarhound around middle threw him yelping into back car doors slammed shut ron didnt touch accelerator but car didnt need him engine roared they were off hitting more spiders they sped up slope out hollow they were soon crashing through forest branches whipping windows as car wound its way cleverly through widest gaps following path it obviously knew harry looked sideways at ron his mouth was still open silent scream but his eyes werent popping anymore are you okay ron stared straight ahead unable speak they smashed their way through undergrowth fang howling loudly back seat harry saw side mirror snap off as they squeezed past large oak after ten noisy rocky minutes trees thinned harry could again see patches sky car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into windshield they had reached edge forest fang flung himself at window his anxiety get out when harry opened door he shot off through trees hagrids house tail between his legs harry got out too after minute or so ron seemed regain feeling his limbs followed still stiffnecked staring harry gave car grateful pat as it reversed back into forest disappeared from view harry went back into hagrids cabin get invisibility cloak fang was trembling under blanket his basket when harry got outside again he found ron being violently sick pumpkin patch follow spiders said ron weakly wiping his mouth on his sleeve ill never forgive hagrid were lucky be alive bet he thought aragog wouldnt hurt friends his said harry thats exactly hagrids problem said ron thumping wall cabin he always thinks monsters arent as bad as theyre 280 made out look where its got him cell azkaban he was shivering uncontrollably now what was point sending us what have we found out id like know that hagrid never opened chamber secrets said harry throwing cloak over ron prodding him arm make him walk he was innocent ron gave loud snort evidently hatching aragog cupboard wasnt his idea being innocent as castle loomed nearer harry twitched cloak make sure their feet were hidden then pushed creaking front doors ajar they walked carefully back across entrance hall up marble staircase holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking at last they reached safety gryffindor common room where fire had burned itself into glowing ash they took off cloak climbed winding stair their dormitory ron fell onto his bed without bothering get undressed harry however didnt feel very sleepy he sat on edge his fourposter thinking hard about everything aragog had said creature that was lurking somewhere castle he thought sounded like sort monster voldemort even other monsters didnt want name it but he ron were no closer finding out what it was or how it petrified its victims even hagrid had never known what was chamber secrets harry swung his legs up onto his bed leaned back against his pillows watching moon glinting at him through tower window he couldnt see what else they could do they had hit dead ends 281 everywhere riddle had caught wrong person heir slytherin had got off no one could tell whether it was same person or different one who had opened chamber this time was nobody else ask harry lay down still thinking about what aragog had said he was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred him he suddenly sat bolt upright ron he hissed through dark ron ron woke with yelp like fangs stared wildly around saw harry ron that girl who died aragog said she was found bathroom said harry ignoring nevilles snufing snores from corner what if she never left bathroom what if shes still ron rubbed his eyes frowning through moonlight then he understood too you dont think not moaning myrtle ll those times we were that bathroom she was just three toilets away said ron bitterly at breakfast next day we couldve asked her now it had been hard enough trying look for spiders escaping their teachers long enough sneak into girls bathroom girls bathroom moreover right next scene first attack was going be almost impossible but something happened their first lesson transfiguration that drove chamber secrets out their minds for first time weeks ten minutes into class professor mcgonagall told them that their exams would start on first june one week from today exams howled seamus finnigan were still getting exams was loud bang behind harry as neville longbottoms wand slipped vanishing one legs on his desk professorr 28 mcgonagall restored it with wave her own wand turned frowning seamus whole point keeping school open at this time is for you receive your education she said sternly exams will therefore take place as usual trust you are all studying hard studying hard it had never occurred harry that would be exams with castle this state was great deal mutinous muttering around room which made professor mcgonagall scowl even more darkly professor dumbledores instructions were keep school running as normally as possible she said that need hardly point out means finding out how much you have learned this year harry looked down at pair white rabbits he was supposed be turning into slippers what had he learned so far this year he couldnt seem think anything that would be useful an exam ron looked as though hed just been told he had go live forbidden forest can you imagine me taking exams with this he asked harry holding up his wand which had just started whistling loudly three days before their first exam professor mcgonagall made another announcement at breakfast have good news she said great hall instead falling silent erupted dumbledores coming back several people yelled joyfully youve caught heir slytherin squealed girl at ravenclaw table 284 quidditch matches are back on roared wood excitedly when hubbub had subsided professor mcgonagall said professor sprout has informed me that mandrakes are ready for cutting at last tonight we will be able revive those people who have been petrified need hardly remind you all that one them may well be able tell us who or what attacked them am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching culprit was an explosion cheering harry looked over at slytherin table wasnt at all surprised see that draco malfoy hadnt joined ron however was looking happier than hed looked days it wont matter that we never asked myrtle then he said harry hermionell probably have all answers when they wake her up mind you shell go crazy when she finds out weve got exams three days time she hasnt studied it might be kinder leave her where she is till theyre over just then ginny weasley came over sat down next ron she looked tense nervous harry noticed that her hands were twisting her lap whats up said ron helping himself more porridge ginny didnt say anything but glanced up down gryffindor table with scared look on her face that reminded harry someone though he couldnt think who spit it out said ron watching her harry suddenly realized who ginny looked like she was rocking backward forward slightly her chair exactly like dobby did when he was teetering on edge revealing forbidden information ive got tell you something ginny mumbled carefully not looking at harry what is it said harry ginny looked as though she couldnt find right words whatsaid ron ginny opened her mouth but no sound came out harry leaned forward spoke quietly so that only ginny ron could hear him is it something about chamber secrets have you seen something someone acting oddly ginny drew deep breath at that precise moment percy weasley appeared looking tired wan if youve finished eating ill take that seat ginny im starving ive only just come off patrol duty ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified gave percy fleeting frightened look scampered away percy sat down grabbed mug from center table percy said ron angrily she was just about tell us some thing important

it did midmorning when they were being led history magic by gilderoy lockhart lockhart who had so often assured them that all danger had passed only be proved wrong right away was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth trouble see them safely down corridors his hair wasnt as sleek as usual it seemed he had been up most night patrolling fourth floor mark my words he said ushering them around corner first words out those poor petrified peoples mouths will be it was hagrid frankly im astounded professor mcgonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary ti agree sir

should go prepare my next class he hurried off prepare his class ron sneered after him gone curl his hair more like they let rest gryffindors draw ahead them then darted down side passage hurried off toward moaning myrtles bathroom but just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme potter weasley what are you doing it was professor mcgonagall her mouth was thinnest thin lines we were we were ron stammered we were going go see hermione said harry ron professor mcgonagall both looked at him we havent seen her for ages professor harry went on hurriedly treading on rons foot we thought wed sneak into hospital wing you know tell her mandrakes are nearly ready er not worry professor mcgonagall was still staring at him for moment harry thought she was going explode but

when theyd taken their seats next hermione it was plain that hermione didnt have faintest inkling that she had visitors that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not worry for all good it would do wonder if she did see attacker though said ron looking sadly at hermiones rigid face because if he sneaked up on them all no onell ever know but harry wasnt looking at hermiones face he was more interested her right hand it lay clenched on top her blankets bending closer he saw that piece paper was scrunched inside her fist making sure that madam pomfrey was nowhere near he pointed this out ron tg get it out ron whispered shifting his chair so that he blocked harry from madam pomfreys view it was no easy task hermiones hand was clamped so tightly around paper that harry was sure he was going tear it while ron kept watch he tugged twisted at last after several tense minutes paper came free it was page torn from very old library book harry smoothed it out eagerly ron leaned close read it too many fearsome beasts monsters that roam our land is none more curious or more deadly than basilisk known also as king serpents this snake which may reach gigantic size live many hundreds years is born from chickens egg hatched beneath toad its methods killing are most wondrous for aside from its deadly venomous fangs basilisk has murderous stare all who are fixed with beam its eye

blast it but he couldnt die again hermione that ravenclaw prefect were found with mirror next them hermione had just realized monster was basilisk bet you anything she warned first person she met look around corners with mirror first that girl pulled out her mirror rods jaw had dropped mrs norris he whispered eagerly harry thought hard picturing scene on night halloween water he said slowly flood from moaning myrtles bathroom bet you mrs norris only saw reflection he scanned page his hand eagerly more he looked at it more it made sense crowing rooster is fatal it he read aloud hagrids roosters were killed heir slytherin didnt want one anywhere near castle once chamber was opened spidersflee before it it all fits but hows basilisk been getting around place said ron giant snake someone

staff room said harry jumping up shell be ten minutes its nearly break they ran downstairs not wanting be discovered hanging around another corridor they went straight into deserted staff room it was large paneled room full dark wooden chairs harry ron paced around it too excited sit down but bell signal break never came instead echoing through corridors came professor mcgon agalls voice magically magnified all students return their house dormitories at once all teach ers return staff room immediately please harry wheeled around stare at ron not another attack not now whatll we do said ron aghast go back dormitory no said harry glancing around was an ugly sort wardrobe his left full teachers cloaks here lets hear what its all about then we can tell them what weve found out they hid themselves inside it listening rumbling hundreds people moving overhead staff room door banging open from between musty folds cloaks they watched teachers filtering into room some them were looking puzzled others downright scared then professor mcgonagall arrived it has happened she told silent staff room student has been taken by monster right into chamber itself professor flitwick let out squeal professor sprout clapped her hands over her mouth snape gripped back chair very hard said how can you be sure heir slytherin said professor mcgonagall who was very white left another message right underneath first one her skeleton will lie chamber forever professor flitwick burst into tears who is it said madam hooch who had sunk weakkneed into chair which student ginny weasley said professor mcgonagall harry felt ron slide silently down onto wardrobe floor beside him we shall have send all students home tomorrow said professor mcgonagall this is end hogwarts dumbledore always said staffroom door banged open again for one wild moment harry was sure it would be dumbledore but it was lockhart he was beaming so sorry dozed off what have missed he didnt seem notice that other teachers were looking at him with something remarkably like hatred snape stepped forward just man he said very man girl has been snatched by monster lockhart taken into chamber secrets itself your moment has come at last lockhart blanched thats right gilderoy chipped professor sprout werent you saying just last night that youve known all along where entrance chamber secrets is well sputtered lockhart yes didnt you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it piped up professor flitwick ddid dont recall certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadnt had crack at monster before hagrid was arrested said snape didnt you say that whole affair had been bungled that you should have been given free rein from first lockhart stared around at his stonyfaced colleagues really never you may have misunderstood well leave it you then gilderoy said professor mcgonagall tonight will be an excellent time do it well make sure everyones out your way youll be able tackle monster all by youself free rein at last lockhart gazed desperately around him but nobody came rescue he didnt look remotely handsome anymore his lip was trembling absence his usually toothy grin he looked weakchinned feeble v very well he said ill ill be my office getting getting ready he left room right said professor mcgonagall whose nostrils were flared thats got him out from under our feet heads houses should go inform their students what has happened tell them hogwarts express will take them home first thing tomorrow will rest you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories teachers rose left one by one it was probably worst day harrys entire life he ron fred george sat together corner gryffindor common room unable say anything each other percy wasnt he had gone send an owl mr mrs weasley then shut himself up his dormitory no afternoon ever lasted as long as that one nor had gryffindor tower ever been so crowded yet so quiet near sunset fred george went up bed unable sit any longer she knew something harry said ron speaking for first time since they had entered wardrobe staff room thats why she was taken it wasnt some stupid thing about percy at all shed found out something about chamber secrets that must be why she was ron rubbed his eyes frantically mean she was pure blood cant be any other reason harry could see sun sinking bloodred below skyline this was worst he had ever felt if only was something they could do anything harry said ron dyou think theres any chance at all shes not you know harry didnt know what say he couldnt see how ginny could still be alive dyou know what said ron think we should go see 295 lockhart tell him what we know hes going try get into chamber we can tell him where we think it is tell him its basilisk because harry couldnt think anything else do because he wanted be doing something he agreed gryffindors around them were so miserable felt so sorry for weasleys that nobody tried stop them as they got up crossed room left through portrait hole darkness was falling as they walked down lockharts office seemed be lot activity going on inside it they could hear scraping thumps hurried footsteps harry knocked was sudden silence from inside then door opened tiniest crack they saw one lockharts eyes peering through it oh mr potter mr weasley he said opening door bit wider im rather busy at moment if you would be quick professor weve got some information for you said harry we think itll help you er well its not terribly side lockharts face that they could see looked very uncomfortable mean well all right he opened door they entered his office had been almost completely stripped two large trunks stood open on floor robes jadegreen lilac midnightblue had been hastily folded into one them books were jumbled untidily into other photographs that had covered walls were now crammed into boxes on desk 296 are you going somewhere said harry er well yes said lockhart ripping lifesize poster himself from back door as he spoke starting roll it up urgent call unavoidable got go what about my sister said ron jerkily well as that most unfortunate said lockhart avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open drawer started emptying contents into bag no one regrets more than youre defense against dark arts teacher said harry you cant go now not with all dark stuff going on here well must say when took job lockhart muttered now piling socks on top his robes nothing job description didnt expect you mean youre running away said harry disbelievingly after all that stuff you did your books books can be misleading said lockhart delicately you wrote them harry shouted my dear boy said lockhart straightening up frowning at harry do use your common sense my books wouldnt have sold half as well if people didnt think id done all those things no one wants read about some ugly old armenian warlock even if he did save village from werewolves hed look dreadful on front cover no dress sense at all witch who banished bandon banshee had harelip mean come on so youve just been taking credit for what load other people have done said harry incredulously harry harry said lockhart shaking his head impatiently its not nearly as simple as that was work involved had 297 track these people down ask them exactly how they managed do what they did then had put memory charm on them so they wouldnt remember doing it if theres one thing pride myself on its my memory charms no its been lot work harry its not all book signings publicity photos you know you want fame you have be prepared for long hard slog he banged lids his trunks shut locked them lets see he said think thats everything yes only one thing left he pulled out his wand turned them awfully sorry boys but ill have put memory charm on you now cant have you blabbing my secrets all over place id never sell another book harry reached his wand just time lockhart had barely raised his when harry bellowed expelliarmus lockhart was blasted backward falling over his trunk his wand flew high into air ron caught it flung it out open window shouldnt have let professor snape teach us that one said harry furiously kicking lockharts trunk aside lockhart was looking up at him feeble once more harry was still pointing his wand at him what dyou want me do said lockhart weakly dont know where chamber secrets is theres nothing can do youre luck said harry forcing lockhart his feet at wandpoint we think we know where it is whats inside it lets go 298 they marched lockhart out his office down nearest stairs along dark corridor where messages shone on wall door moaning myrtles bathroom they sent lockhart first harry was pleased see that he was shaking moaning myrtle was sitting on tank end toilet oh its you she said when she saw harry what do you want this time ask you how you died said harry myrtles whole aspect changed at once she looked as though she had never been asked such flattering question ooooh it was dreadful she said with relish it happened right here died this very stall remember it so well id hidden because olive hornby was teasing me about my glasses door was locked was crying then heard somebody come they said something funny different language think it must have been anyway what really got me was that it was boy speaking so unlocked door tell him go use his own toilet then myrtle swelled importantly her face shining died how said harry no idea said myrtle hushed tones just remember seeing pair great big yellow eyes my whole body sort seized up then was floating away she looked dreamily at harry then came back again was determined haunt olive hornby you see oh she was sorry shed ever laughed at my glasses where exactly did you see eyes said harry 299 somewhere said myrtle pointing vaguely toward sink front her toilet harry ron hurried over it lockhart was standing well back look utter terror on his face it looked like an ordinary sink they examined every inch it inside out including pipes below then harry saw it scratched on side one copper taps was tiny snake that taps never worked said myrtle brightly as he tried turn it harry said ron say something something parseltongue but harry thought hard only times hed ever managed speak parseltongue were when hed been faced with real snake he stared hard at tiny engraving trying imagine it was real open up he said he looked at ron who shook his head english he said harry looked back at snake willing himself believe it was alive if he moved his head candlelight made it look as though it were moving open up he said except that words werent what he heard strange hissing had escaped him at once tap glowed with brilliant white light began spin next second sink began move sink fact sank right out sight leaving large pipe exposed pipe wide enough for man slide into harry heard ron gasp looked up again he had made up his mind what he was going do 300 im going down he said he couldnt not go not now they had found entrance chamber not if was even faintest slimmest wildest chance that ginny might be alive me too said ron was pause well you hardly seem need me said lockhart with shadow his old smile ill just he put his hand on door knob but ron harry both pointed their wands at him you can go first ron snarled whitefaced wandless lockhart approached opening boys he said his voice feeble boys what good will it do harry jabbed him back with his wand lockhart slid his legs into pipe really dont think he started say but ron gave him push he slid out sight harry followed quickly he lowered himself slowly into pipe then let go it was like rushing down an endless slimy dark slide he could see more pipes branching off all directions but none as large as theirs which twisted turned sloping steeply downward he knew that he was falling deeper below school than even dungeons behind him he could hear ron thudding slightly at curves then just as he had begun worry about what would happen when he hit ground pipe leveled out he shot out end with wet thud landing on damp floor dark stone tunnel large enough stand lockhart was getting his 301 feet little ways away covered slime white as ghost harry stood aside as ron came whizzing out pipe too we must be miles under school said harry his voice echoing black tunnel under lake probably said ron squinting around at dark slimy walls all three them turned stare into darkness ahead lumos harry muttered his wand it lit again cmon he said ron lockhart off they went their footsteps slapping loudly on wet floor tunnel was so dark that they could only see little distance ahead their shadows on wet walls looked monstrous wandlight remember harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward any sign movement close your eyes right away but tunnel was quiet as grave first unexpected sound they heard was loud crunch as ron stepped on what turned out be rats skull harry lowered his wand look at floor saw that it was littered with small animal bones trying very hard not imagine what ginny might look like if they found her harry led way forward around dark bend tunnel harry theres something up said ron hoarsely grabbing harrys shoulder they froze watching harry could just see outline something huge curved lying right across tunnel it wasnt moving maybe its asleep he breathed glancing back at other two lockharts hands were pressed over his eyes harry turned back look at thing his heart beating so fast it hurt 302 very slowly his eyes as narrow as he could make them still see harry edged forward his wand held high light slid over gigantic snake skin vivid poisonous green lying curled empty across tunnel floor creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least blimey said ron weakly was sudden movement behind them gilderoy lockharts knees had given way get up said ron sharply pointing his wand at lockhart lockhart got his feet then he dived at ron knocking him ground harry jumped forward but too late lockhart was straightening up panting rons wand his hand gleaming smile back on his face adventure ends here boys he said shall take bit this skin back up school tell them was too late save girl that you two tragically lost your minds at sight her mangled body say goodbye your memories he raised rons spellotaped wand high over his head yelled obliviate wand exploded with force small bomb harry flung his arms over his head ran slipping over coils snake skin out way great chunks tunnel ceiling that were thundering floor next moment he was standing alone gazing at solid wall broken rock ron he shouted are you okay ron im here came rons muffled voice from behind rockfall im okay this gits not though he got blasted by wand 303 was dull thud loud ow it sounded as though ron had just kicked lockhart shins what now rons voice said sounding desperate we cant get through itll take ages harry looked up at tunnel ceiling huge cracks had appeared it he had never tried break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic now didnt seem good moment try what if whole tunnel caved was another thud another ow from behind rocks they were wasting time ginny had already been chamber secrets for hours harry knew was only one thing do wait he called ron wait with lockhart ill go on if im not back an hour was very pregnant pause ill try shift some this rock said ron who seemed be trying keep his voice steady so you can can get back through harry see you bit said harry trying inject some confidence into his shaking voice he set off alone past giant snake skin soon distant noise ron straining shift rocks was gone tunnel turned turned again every nerve harrys body was tingling unpleasantly he wanted tunnel end yet dreaded what hed find when it did then at last as he crept around yet another bend he saw solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved their eyes set with great glinting emeralds 304 harry approached his throat very dry was no need pretend these stone snakes were real their eyes looked strangely alive he could guess what he had do he cleared his throat emerald eyes seemed flicker open said harry low faint hiss serpents parted as wall cracked open halves slid smoothly out sight harry shaking from head foot walked inside e was standing at end very long dimly lit chamber towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose support ceiling lost darkness casting long black shadows through odd greenish gloom that filled place his heart beating very fast harry stood listening chill silence could basilisk be lurking shadowy corner behind pillar where was ginny he pulled out his wand moved forward between serpentine columns every careful footstep echoed loudly off shadowy walls he kept his eyes narrowed ready clamp them shut at smallest sign movement hollow eye sockets stone snakes seemed be following him more than once with jolt stomach he thought he saw one stir then as he drew level with last pair pillars statue high as chamber itself loomed into view standing against back wall 306 harry had crane his neck look up into giant face above it was ancient monkeyish with long thin beard that fell almost bottom wizards sweeping stone robes where two enormous gray feet stood on smooth chamber floor between feet facedown lay small blackrobed figure with flamingred hair tinny harry muttered sprinting her dropping his knees tinny dont be dead please dont be dead he flung his wand aside grabbed ginnys shoulders turned her over her face was white as marble as cold yet her eyes were closed so she wasnt petrified but then she must be ginny please wake up harry muttered desperately shaking her ginnys head lolled hopelessly from side side she wont wake said soft voice harry jumped spun around on his knees tall blackhaired boy was leaning against nearest pillar watching he was strangely blurred around edges as though harry were looking at him through misted window but was no mistaking him tom tom riddle riddle nodded not taking his eyes off harrys face what dyou mean she wont wake harry said desperately shes not shes not shes still alive said riddle but only just harry stared at him tom riddle had been at hogwarts fifty years ago yet here he stood weird misty light shining about him not day older than sixteen are you ghost harry said uncertainly 30 7 memory said riddle quietly preserved diary for fifty years he pointed toward floor near statues giant toes lying open was little black diary harry had found moaning myrtles bathroom for second harry wondered how it had got but were more pressing matters deal with youve got help me tom harry said raising ginnys head again weve got get her out here theres basilisk dont know where it is but it could be along any moment please help me 1 riddle didnt move harry sweating managed hoist ginny half off floor bent pick up his wand again but his wand had gone did you see he looked up riddle was still watching him twirling harrys wand between his long fingers thanks said harry stretching out his hand for it smile curled corners riddles mouth he continued stare at harry twirling wand idly listen said harry urgently his knees sagging with ginnys dead weight weve got go if basilisk comes it wont come until it is called said riddle calmly harry lowered ginny back onto floor unable hold her up any longer what dyou mean he said look give me my wand might need it riddles smile broadened you wont be needing it he said 08 harry stared at him what dyou mean wont be ive waited long time for this harry potter said riddle for chance see you speak you look said harry losing patience dont think you get it were chamber secrets we can talk later were going talk now said riddle still smiling broadly he pocketed harrys wand harry stared at him was something very funny going on here how did ginny get like this he asked slowly well thats an interesting question said riddle pleasantly quite long story suppose real reason ginny weasleys like this is because she opened her heart spilled all her secrets an invisible stranger what are you talking about said harry diary said riddle my diary little ginnys been writing it for months months telling me all her pitiful worries woes how her brothers tease her how she had come school with secondhand robes books how riddles eyes glinted how she didnt think famous good great harry potter would ever like her all time he spoke riddles eyes never left harrys face was an almost hungry look them its very boring having listen silly little troubles an eleven yearold girl he went on but was patient wrote back was sympathetic was kind ginny simply loved me no ones ever understood me like you tom im so glad ive got this diary 309 confide its like having friend can carry around my pocket riddle laughed high cold laugh that didnt suit him it made hairs stand up on back harrys neck if say it myself harry ive always been able charm people needed so ginny poured out her soul me her soul happened be exactly what wanted grew stronger stronger on diet her deepest fears her darkest secrets grew powerful far more powerful than little miss weasley powerful enough start feeding miss weasley few my secrets start pouring little my soul back into her what dyou mean said harry whose mouth had gone very dry havent you guessed yet harry potter said riddle softly ginny weasley opened chamber secrets she strangled school roosters daubed threatening messages on walls she set serpent slytherin on four mudbloods squibs cat no harry whispered yes said riddle calmly course she didnt know what she was doing at first it was very amusing wish you could have seen her new diary entries far more interesting they became dear tom he recited watching harrys horrified face think im losing my memory are rooster feathers all over my robes 1 dont know how they got dear tom l cant remember what 1 did on night halloween but cat was attacked ive got paint all down my front dear tom percy keeps telling me im pale im not myself think he suspects me was another attack today 310 dont know where was tom what am going do think im going mad think im one attacking everyone tom harrys fists were clenched nails digging deep into his palms it took very long time for stupid little ginny stop trusting her diary said riddle but she finally became suspicious tried dispose it thats where you came harry you found it couldnt have been more delighted all people who could have picked it up it was you very person was most anxious meet why did you want meet me said harry anger was coursing through him it was an effort keep his voice steady well you see ginny told me all about you harry said riddle your whole fascinating history his eyes roved over lightning scar on harrys forehead their expression grew hungrier knew must find out more about you talk you meet you if could so decided show you my famous capture that great oaf hagrid gain your trust hagrids my friend said harry his voice now shaking you framed him didnt you thought you made mistake but riddle laughed his high laugh again it was my word against hagrids harry well you can imagine how it looked old armando dippet on one hand tom riddle poor but brilliant parentless but so brave school prefect model student on other hand big blundering hagrid trouble every other week trying raise werewolf cubs under his bed sneaking off forbidden forest wrestle trolls but 31l admit even was surprised how well plan worked thought someone must realize that hagrid couldnt possibly be heir slytherin it had taken me five whole years find out everything could about chamber secrets discover secret entrance as though hagrid had brains or power only transfiguration teacher dumbledore seemed think hagrid was innocent he persuaded dipper keep hagrid train him as gamekeeper yes think dumbledore might have guessed dumbledore never seemed like me as much as other teachers did bet dumbledore saw right through you said harry his teeth gritted well he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after hagrid was expelled said riddle carelessly knew it wouldnt be safe open chamber again while was still at school but wasnt going waste those long years id spent searching for it decided leave behind diary preserving my sixteenyearold self its pages so that one day with luck would be able lead another my footsteps finish salazar slytherins noble work well you havent finished it said harry triumphantly no ones died this time not even cat few hours mandrake draught will be ready everyone who was petrified will be all right again havent already told you said riddle quietly that killing mudbloods doesnt matter me anymore for many months now my new target has been you harry stared at him imagine how angry was when next time my diary was 312 opened it was ginny who was writing me not you she saw you with diary you see panicked what if you found out how work it repeated all her secrets you what if even worse told you whod been strangling roosters so foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted stole it back but knew what must do it was clear me that you were on trail slytherins heir from everything ginny had told me about you knew you would go any lengths solve mystery particularly if one your best friends was attacked ginny had told me whole school was buzzing because you could speak parseltongue so made ginny write her own farewell on wall come down here wait she struggled cried became very boring but isnt much life left her she put too much into diary into me enough let me leave its pages at last have been waiting for you appear since we arrived here knew youd come have many questions for you harry potter like what harry spat fists still clenched well said riddle smiling pleasantly how is it that you skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent managed defeat greatest wizard all time how did you escape with nothing but scar while lord voldemorts powers were destroyed was an odd red gleam his hungry eyes now why do you care how escaped said harry slowly voldemort was after your time voldemort said riddle softly is my past present future harry potter he pulled harrys wand from his pocket began trace it through air writing three shimmering words tom marvolo riddle then he waved wand once letters his name rearranged themselves am lord voldemort you see he whispered it was name was already using at hogwarts my most intimate friends only course you think was going use my filthy muggle fathers name forever whose veins runs blood salazar slytherin himself through my mothers side keep name foul common muggle who abandoned me even before was born just because he found out his wife was witch no harry fashioned myself new name name knew wizards everywhere would one day fear speak when had become greatest sorcerer world harrys brain seemed have jammed he stared numbly at riddle at orphaned boy who had grown up murder harrys own parents so many others at last he forced himself peak youre not he said his quiet voice full hatred not what snapped riddle not greatest sorcerer world said harry breathing fast sorry disappoint you all that but greatest wizard world is albus dumbledore everyone says so even when you were strong you didnt dare try take over at hogwarts dumbledore saw through you when you were at school he still frightens you now wherever youre hiding these days smile had gone from riddles face be replaced by very ugly look 314 dumbledores been driven out this castle by mere memory me he hissed hes not as gone as you might think harry retorted he was speaking at random wanting scare riddle wishing rather than believing it be true riddle opened his mouth but froze music was coming from somewhere riddle whirled around stare down empty chamber music was growing louder it was eerie spinetingling unearthly it lifted hair on harrys scalp made his heart feel as though it was swelling twice its normal size then as music reached such pitch that harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs flames erupted at top nearest pillar crimson bird size swan had appeared piping its weird music vaulted ceiling it had glittering golden tail as long as peacocks gleaming golden talons which were gripping ragged bundle second later bird was flying straight at harry it dropped ragged thing it was carrying at his feet then landed heavily on his shoulder as it folded its great wings harry looked up saw it had long sharp golden beak beady black eye bird stopped singing it sat still warm next harrys cheek gazing steadily at riddle thats phoenix said riddle staring shrewdly back at it fawkes harry breathed he felt birds golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently that said riddle now eyeing ragged thing that fawkes had dropped thats old school sorting hat so it was patched frayed dirty hat lay motionless at harrys feet riddle began laugh again he laughed so hard that dark chamber rang with it as though ten riddles were laughing at once this is what dumbledore sends his defender songbird an old hat do you feel brave harry potter do you feel safe now harry didnt answer he might not see what use fawkes or sorting hat were but he was no longer alone he waited for riddle stop laughing with his courage mounting business harry said riddle still smiling broadly twice your past my future we have met twice failed kill you how did you survive tell me everything longer you talk he added softly longer you stay alive harry was thinking fast weighing his chances riddle had wand he harry had fawkes sorting hat neither which would be much good duel it looked bad all right but longer riddle stood more life was dwindling out ginny meantime harry noticed suddenly riddles outline was becoming clearer more solid if it had be fight between him riddle better sooner than later no one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me said harry abruptly dont know myself but know why you couldnt kill me because my mother died save me my common muggleborn mother he added shaking with suppressed rage she stopped you killing me ive seen real you saw you last year youre wreck youre barely alive thats where all your power got you youre hiding youre ugly youre foul 16 riddles face contorted then he forced it into an awful smile so your mother died save you yes thats powerful countercharm can see now is nothing special about you after all wondered you see are strange likenesses between us after all even you must have noticed both halfbloods orphans raised by muggles probably only two parselmouths come hogwarts since great slytherin himself we even look something alike but after all it was merely lucky chance that saved you from me thats all wanted know harry stood tense waiting for riddle raise his wand but riddles twisted smile was widening again now harry im going teach you little lesson lets match powers lord voldemort heir salazar slytherin against famous harry potter best weapons dumbledore can give him he cast an amused eye over fawkes sorting hat then walked away harry fear spreading up his numb legs watched ridthe stop between high pillars look up into stone face slytherin high above him halfdarkness riddle opened his mouth wide hissed but harry understood what he was saying speak me slytherin greatest hogwarts four harry wheeled around look up at statue fawkes swaying on his shoulder slytherins gigantic stone face was moving horrorstruck harry saw his mouth opening wider wider make huge black hole something was stirring inside statues mouth something was slithering up from its depths 3 1 harry backed away until he hit dark chamber wall as he shut his eyes tight he felt fawkes wing sweep his cheek as he took flight harry wanted shout dont leave me but what chance did phoenix have against king serpents something huge hit stone floor chamber harry felt it shudder he knew what was happening he could sense it could almost see giant serpent uncoiling itself from slytherins mouth then he heard riddles hissing voice kill him basilisk was moving toward harry he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across dusty floor eyes still tightly shut harry began run blindly sideways his hands outstretched feeling his way voldemort was laughing harry tripped he fell hard onto stone tasted blood serpent was barely feet from him he could hear it coming was loud explosive spitting sound right above him then something heavy hit harry so hard that he was smashed into wall waiting for fangs sink through his body he heard more mad hissing something thrashing wildly off pillars he couldnt help it he opened his eyes wide enough squint at what was going on enormous serpent bright poisonous green thick as an oak trunk had raised itself high air its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between pillars as harry trembled ready close his eyes if it turned he saw what had distracted snake fawkes was soaring around its head basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long thin as sabers fawkes dived his long golden beak sank out sight 318 sudden shower dark blood spattered floor snakes tail thrashed narrowly missing harry before harry could shut his eyes it turned harry looked straight into its face saw that its eyes both its great bulbous yellow eyes had been punctured by phoenix blood was streaming floor snake was spitting agony no harry heard riddle screaming leave bird leave bird boy is behind you you can still smell him kill himi blinded serpent swayed confused still deadly fawkes was circling its head piping his eerie song jabbing here at its scaly nose as blood poured from its ruined eyes help me help me harry muttered wildly someone anyone snakes tail whipped across floor again harry ducked something soft hit his face basilisk had swept sorting hat into harrys arms harry seized it it was all he had left his only chance he rammed it onto his head threw himself flat onto floor as basilisks tail swung over him again help me help me harry thought his eyes screwed tight under hat please help me was no answering voice instead hat contracted as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly something very hard heavy thudded onto top harrys head almost knocking him out stars winking front his eyes he grabbed top hat pull it off felt something long hard beneath it 3 19 gleaming silver sword had appeared inside hat its handle glittering with rubies size eggs kill boy leave bird boy is behind you sniff smell him harry was on his feet ready basilisks head was falling its body coiling around hitting pillars as it twisted face him he could see vast bloody eye sockets see mouth stretching wide wide enough swallow him whole lined with fangs long as his sword thin glittering venomous it lunged blindly harry dodged it hit chamber wall it lunged again its forked tongue lashed harrys side he raised sword both his hands basilisk lunged again this time its aim was true harry threw his whole weight behind sword drove it hilt into roof serpents mouth but as warm blood drenched harrys arms he felt searing pain just above his elbow one long poisonous fang was sinking deeper deeper into his arm it splintered as basilisk keeled over sideways fell twitching floor harry slid down wall he gripped fang that was spreading poison through his body wrenched it out his arm but he knew it was too late whitehot pain was spreading slowly steadily from wound even as he dropped fang watched his own blood soaking his robes his vision went foggy chamber was dissolving whirl dull color patch scarlet swam past harry heard soft clatter claws beside him fawkes said harry thickly you were fantastic fawkes 1520 he felt bird lay its beautiful head on spot where serpents fang had pierced him he could hear echoing footsteps then dark shadow moved front him youre dead harry potter said riddles voice above him dead even dumbledores bird knows it do you see what hes doing potter hes crying harry blinked fawkes head slid out

me he raised wand then rush wings fawkes had soared back overhead something fell into harrys lap diary for split second both harry riddle wand still raised stared at it then without thinking without considering as though he had meant do it all along harry seized basilisk fang on floor next him plunged it straight into heart book was long dreadful piercing scream ink spurted out diary torrents streaming over harrys hands flooding floor riddle was writhing twisting screaming flailing then he had gone harrys wand fell floor with clatter was silence silence except for steady drip drip ink still oozing from diary basilisk venom had burned sizzling hole right through it shaking all over harry pulled himself up his head was spinning as though hed just traveled miles by floo powder slowly he gathered together his wand sorting hat with huge tug retrieved glittering sword from roof basilisks mouth then came faint moan from end chamber ginny was stirring as harry hurried toward her she sat up her bemused 1522 eyes traveled from huge form dead basilisk over harry his bloodsoaked robes then diary his hand she drew great shuddering gasp tears began pour down her face harry oh harry

ginny forward they stepped over motionless coils dead basilisk through echoing gloom back into tunnel harry heard stone doors close behind them with soft hiss after few minutes progress up dark tunnel distant sound slowly shifting rock reached harrys ears ron harry yelled speeding up ginnys okay ive got her he heard ron give strangled cheer they turned next bend see his eager face staring through sizable gap he had managed make rock fall ginny ron thrust an arm through gap rock pull 3213 her through first youre alive dont believe it what happened how what where did that bird come from fawkes had swooped through gap after ginny hes dumbledores said harry squeezing through himself how come youve got sword said ron gaping at glittering weapon harrys hand ill explain when we get out here said harry with sideways glance at ginny who was crying harder than ever but later harry said shortly he didnt think it was good idea tell ron yet whod been opening chamber not front ginny anyway wheres lockhart back said ron still looking puzzled but jerking his head up tunnel toward pipe hes bad way come see led by fawkes whose wide scarlet wings emitted soft golden glow darkness they walked all way back mouth pipe gilderoy lockhart was sitting humming placidly himself his memorys gone said ron memory charm backfired hit him instead us hasnt got clue who he is or where he is or who we are told him come wait here hes danger himself lockhart peered goodnaturedly up at them all hello he said odd sort place this isnt it do you live here no said ron raising his eyebrows at harry harry bent down looked up long dark pipe have you thought how were going get back up this he said ron 324 ron shook his head but fawkes phoenix had swooped past harry was now fluttering front him his beady eyes bright dark he was waving his long golden tail feathers harry looked uncertainly at him he looks like he wants you grab hold said ron looking perplexed but youre much too heavy for bird pull up fawkes said harry isnt an ordinary bird he turned quickly others weve got hold on each other ginny grab rons hand professor lockhart he means you said ron sharply lockhart you hold ginnys other hand harry tucked sword sorting hat into his belt ron took hold back harrys robes harry reached out took hold fawkess strangely hot tail feathers an extraordinary lightness seemed spread through his whole body next second rush wings they were flying upward through pipe harry could hear lockhart dangling below him saying amazing amazing this is just like magic chill air was whipping through harrys hair before hed stopped enjoying ride it was over all four them were hitting wet floor moaning myrtles bathroom as lockhart straightened his hat sink that hid pipe was sliding back into place myrtle goggled at them youre alive she said blankly harry theres no need sound so disappointed he said grimly wiping flecks blood slime off his glasses 325 oh well id just been thinking if you had died youd have been welcome share my toilet said myrtle blushing silver urgh said ron as they left bathroom for dark deserted corridor outside harry think myrtles grown fond you youve got competition ginny but tears were still flooding silently down ginnys face where now said ron with an anxious look at ginny harry pointed fawkes was leading way glowing gold along corridor they strode after him moments later found themselves outside professor mcgonagalls office harry knocked pushed door open g fi p t e ir k g 14 t v v n do y reward or moment was silence as harry ron ginny lockhart stood doorway covered muck slime harrys case blood then was scream ginny it was mrs weasley who had been sitting crying front fire she leapt her feet closely followed by mr weasley both them flung themselves on their daughter harry however was looking past them professor dumbledore was standing by mantelpiece beaming next professor mcgonagall who was taking great steadying gasps clutching her chest fawkes went whooshing past harrys ear settled on dumbledores shoulder just as harry found himself ron being swept into mrs weasleys tight embrace you saved her you saved her how did you do it think wed all like know that said professor mcgonagall weakly mrs weasley let go harry who hesitated for moment then walked over desk laid upon it sorting hat rubyencrusted sword what remained riddles diary then he started telling them everything for nearly quarter an hour he spoke into rapt silence he told them about hearing disembodied voice how hermione had finally realized that he was hearing basilisk pipes how he ron had followed spiders into forest that aragog had told them where last victim basilisk had died how he had guessed that moaning myrtle had been victim that entrance chamber secrets might be her bathroom very well professor mcgonagall prompted him as he paused so you found out where entrance was breaking hundred school rules into pieces along way might add but how on earth did you all get out alive potter so harry his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking told them about fawkess timely arrival about sorting hat giving him sword but then he faltered he had so far avoided mentioning riddles diary or ginny she was standing with her head against mrs weasleys shoulder tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks what if they expelled her harry thought panic riddles diary didnt work anymore how could they prove it had been he whod made her do it all instinctively harry looked at dumbledore who smiled faintly firelight glancing off his halfmoon spectacles what interests me most said dumbledore gently is how lord voldemort managed enchant ginny when my sources tell me he is currently hiding forests albania 328 relief warm sweeping glorious relief swept over harry w whats that said mr weasley stunned voice youknowwho enenchant ginny but ginnys not ginny hasnt been has she it was this diary said harry quickly picking it up showing it dumbledore riddle wrote it when he was sixteen dumbledore took diary from harry peered keenly down his long crooked nose at its burnt soggy pages brilliant he said softly course he was probably most brilliant student hogwarts has ever seen he turned around weasleys who were looking utterly bewildered very few people know that lord voldemort was once called tom riddle taught him myself fifty years ago at hogwarts he disappeared after leaving school traveled far wide sank so deeply into dark arts consorted with very worst our kind underwent so many dangerous magical transformations that when he resurfaced as lord voldemort he was barely recognizable hardly anyone connected lord voldemort with clever handsome boy who was once head boy here but ginny said mrs weasley whats our ginny got do with with him his ddiaryl ginny sobbed ive bbeen writing it hes been wwriting back all year tinny said mr weasley flabbergasted havent taught you anything what have always told you never trust anything that can think for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brain why didnt you show diary me or your mother suspicious object like that it was clearly full dark magic 329 ddidnt know sobbed ginny found it inside one books mum got me ththought someone had just left it forgotten about it miss weasley should go up hospital wing right away dumbledore interrupted firm voice this has been terrible ordeal for her will be no punishment older wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by lord voldemort he strode over door opened it bed rest perhaps large steaming mug hot chocolate always find that cheers me up he added twinkling kindly down at her you will find that madam pomfrey is still awake shes just giving out mandrake juice daresay basilisks victims will be waking up any moment so hermiones okay said ron brightly has been no lasting harm done ginny said dumbledore mrs weasley led ginny out mr weasley followed still looking deeply shaken you know minerva professor dumbledore said thoughtfully professor mcgonagall think all this merits good feast might ask you go alert kitchens right said professor mcgonagall crisply also moving door ill leave you deal with potter weasley shall certainly said dumbledore she left harry ron gazed uncertainly at dumbledore what exactly had professor mcgonagall meant deal with them surely surely they werent about be punished seem remember telling you both that would have expel you if you broke any more school rules said dumbledore 30 ron opened his mouth horror which goes show that best us must sometimes eat our words dumbledore went on smiling you will both receive special awards for services school let me see yes think two hundred points apiece for gryffindor ron went as briglitly pink as lockharts valentine flowers closed his mouth again but one us seems be keeping mightily quiet about his part this dangerous adventure dumbledore added why so modest gilderoy harry gave start he had completely forgotten about lockhart he turned saw that lockhart was standing corner room still wearing his vague smile when dumbledore addressed him lockhart looked over his shoulder see who he was talking professor dumbledore ron said quickly was an accident down chamber secrets professor lockhart am professor said lockhart mild surprise goodness expect was hopeless was he tried do memory charm wand backfired ron explained quietly dumbledore dear me said dumbledore shaking his head his long silver mustache quivering impaled upon your own sword gilderoy sword said lockhart dimly havent got sword that boy has though he pointed at harry hell lend you one would you mind taking professor lockhart up infirmary too dumbledore said ron id like few more words with harry lockhart ambled out ron cast curious look back at dumbledore harry as he closed door dumbledore crossed one chairs by fire sit down harry he said harry sat feeling unaccountably nervous first all harry want thank you said dumbledore eyes twinkling again you must have shown me real loyalty down chamber nothing but that could have called fawkes you he stroked phoenix which had fluttered down onto his knee harry grinned awkwardly as dumbledore watched him so you met tom riddle said dumbledore thoughtfully imagine he was most interested you suddenly something that was nagging at harry came tumbling out his mouth professor dumbledore riddle said im like him strange likenesses he said did he now said dumbledore looking thoughtfully at harry from under his thick silver eyebrows what do you think harry dont think im like him said harry more loudly than hed intended mean im im gryffindor im but he fell silent lurking doubt resurfacing his mind professor he started again after moment sorting hat told me id id have done well slytherin everyone thought was slytherins heir for while because can speak parseltongue you can speak parseltongue harry said dumbledore calmly because lord voldemort who is last remaining ancestor 32 salazar slytherin can speak parseltongue unless im much mistaken he transferred some his own powers you night he gave you that scar not something he intended do im sure voldemort put bit himself me harry said thunderstruck it certainly seems so so should be slytherin harry said looking desperately into dumbledores face sorting hat could see slytherins power me it put you gryffindor said dumbledore calmly listen me harry you happen have many qualities salazar slytherin prized his hand picked students his own very rare gift parseltongue resourcefulness determination certain disregard for rules he added his mustache quivering again yet sorting hat placed you gryffindor you know why that was think it only put me gryffindor said harry defeated voice because asked not go slytherin exactly said dumbledore beaming once more which makes you very different from tom riddle it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities harry sat motionless his chair stunned if you want proof harry that you belong gryffindor suggest you look more closely at this dumbledore reached across professor mcgonagalls desk picked up bloodstained silver sword handed it harry dully harry turned it over rubies blazing firelight then he saw name engraved just below hilt godric gryffindor 333 only true gryffindor could have pulled that out hat harry said dumbledore simply for minute neither them spoke then dumbledore pulled open one drawers professor mcgonagalls desk took out quill bottle ink what you need harry is some food sleep suggest you go down feast while write azkaban we need our gamekeeper back must draft an advertisement for daily prophet too he added thoughtfully well be needing new defense against dark arts teacher dear me we do seem run through them dont we harry got up crossed door he had just reached for handle however when door burst open so violently that it bounced back off wall lucius malfoy stood fury his face cowering behind his legs heavily wrapped bandages was dobby good evening lucius said dumbledore pleasantly mr malfoy almost knocked harry over as he swept into room dobby went scurrying after him crouching at hem his cloak look abject terror on his face elf was carrying stained rag with which he was attempting finish cleaning mr malfoys shoes apparently mr malfoy had set out great hurry for not only were his shoes halfpolished but his usually sleek hair was disheveled ignoring elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles he fixed his cold eyes upon dumbledore so he said youve come back governors suspended you but you still saw fit return hogwarts 4 well you see lucius said dumbledore smiling serenely other eleven governors contacted me today it was something like being caught hailstorm owls tell truth theyd heard that arthur weasleys daughter had been killed wanted me back here at once they seemed think was best man for job after all very strange tales they told me too several them seemed think that you had threatened curse their families if they didnt agree suspend me first place mr malfoy went even paler than usual but his eyes were still slits fury so have you stopped attacks yet he sneered have you caught culprit we have said dumbledore with smile wellsaid mr malfoy sharply who is it same person as last time lucius said dumbledore but this time lord voldemort was acting through somebody else by means this diary he held up small black book with large hole through center watching mr malfoy closely harry however was watching dobby elf was doing something very odd his great eyes fixed meaningfully on harry he kept pointing at diary then at mr malfoy then hitting himself hard on head with his fist see said mr malfoy slowly dumbledore clever plan said dumbledore level voice still staring mr malfoy straight eye because if harry here mr malfoy shot harry swift sharp look his friend ron hadnt discovered this book why ginny weasley might have taken all 335 blame no one would ever have been able prove she hadnt acted her own free will mr malfoy said nothing his face was suddenly masklike imagine dumbledore went on what might have happened then weasleys are one our most prominent pureblood families imagine effect on arthur weasley his muggle protection act if his own daughter was discovered attacking killing muggleborns very fortunate diary was discovered riddles memories wiped from it who knows what consequences might have been otherwise mr malfoy forced himself speak very fortunate he said stiffly still behind his back dobby was pointing first diary then lucius malfoy then punching himself head harry suddenly understood he nodded at dobby dobby backed into corner now twisting his ears punishment dont you want know how ginny got hold that diary mr malfoy said harry lucius malfoy rounded on him how should know how stupid little girl got hold it he said because you gave it her said harry flourish blotts you picked up her old transfiguration book slipped diary inside it didnt you he saw mr malfoys white hands clench unclench prove it he hissed oh no one will be able do that said dumbledore smiling at harry not now that riddle has vanished from book on 336 other hand would advise you lucius not go giving out any more lord voldemorts old school things if any more them find their way into innocent hands think arthur weasley for one will make sure they are traced back you lucius malfoy stood for moment harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing reach for his wand instead he turned his houseelf were going dobby he wrenched open door as elf came hurrying up him he kicked him right through it they could hear dobby squealing with pain all way along corridor harry stood for moment thinking hard then it came him professor dumbledore he said hurriedly can give that diary back mr malfoy please certainly harry said dumbledore calmly but hurry feast remember harry grabbed diary dashed out office he could hear dobbys squeals pain receding around corner quickly wondering if this plan could possibly work harry took off one his shoes pulled off his slimy filthy sock stuffed diary into it then he ran down dark corridor he caught up with them at top stairs mr malfoy he gasped skidding halt ive got something for you he forced smelly sock into lucius malfoys hand what mr malfoy ripped sock off diary threw it aside then looked furiously from ruined book harry 531 youll meet same sticky end as your parents one these days harry potter he said softly they were meddlesome fools too he turned go come dobby said come but dobby didnt move he was holding up harrys disgusting slimy sock looking at it as though it were priceless treasure master has given sock said elf wonderment master gave it dobby whats that spat mr malfoy what did you say got sock said dobby disbelief master threw it dobby caught it dobby dobby is free lucius malfoy stood frozen staring at elf then he lunged at harry youve lost me my servant boy but dobby shouted you shall not harm harry potter was loud bang mr malfoy was thrown backward he crashed down stairs three at time landing crumpled heap on landing below he got up his face livid pulled out his wand but dobby raised long threatening finger you shall go now he said fiercely pointing down at mr malfoy you shall not touch harry potter you shall go now lucius malfoy had no choice with last incensed stare at pair them he swung his cloak around him hurried out sight harry potter freed dobby said elf shrilly gazing up at harry moonlight from nearest window reflected his orblike eyes harry potter set dobby free least could do dobby said harry grinning just promise never try save my life again elfs ugly brown face split suddenly into wide toothy smile ive just got one question dobby said harry as dobby pulled on harrys sock with shaking hands you told me all this had nothing do with hewhomustnotbenamed remember well it was clue sir said dobby his eyes widening as though this was obvious was giving you clue dark lord before he changed his name could be freely named you see right said harry weakly well id better go theres feast my friend hermione should be awake by now dobby threw his arms around harrys middle hugged him harry potter is greater by far than dobby knew he sobbed farewell harry potter with final loud crack dobby disappeared harry had been several hogwarts feasts but never one quite like this everybody was their pajamas celebration lasted all night harry didnt know whether best bit was hermione running toward him screaming you solved it you solved it or justin hurrying over from hufflepuff table wring his hand apologize endlessly for suspecting him or hagrid turning up at half past three cuffing harry ron so hard on shoulders that they were knocked into their plates trifle or his rons four hundred points for gryffindor securing house cup for second year running or professor mcgonagall standing up 339 tell them all that exams had been canceled as school treat oh no said hermione or dumbledore announcing that unfortunately professor lockhart would be unable return next year owing fact that he needed go away get his memory back quite few teachers joined cheering that greeted this news shame said ron helping himself jam doughnut he was starting grow on me rest final term passed haze blazing sunshine hogwarts was back normal with only few small differences defense against dark arts classes were canceled but weve had plenty practice at that anyway ron told disgruntled hermione lucius malfoy had been sacked as school governor draco was no longer strutting around school as though he owned place on contrary he looked resentful sulky on other hand ginny weasley was perfectly happy again too soon it was time for journey home on hogwarts express harry ron hermione fred george ginny got compartment themselves they made most last few hours which they were allowed do magic before holidays they played exploding snap set off very last fred georges filibuster fireworks practiced disarming each other by magic harry was getting very good at it they were almost at kings cross when harry remembered something ginny what did you see percy doing that he didnt
