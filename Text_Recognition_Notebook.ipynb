            "harry potter sorcerers stone chapter one boy who lived mr mrs dursley number four privet drive were proud say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were last people youd expect be involved anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsense mr dursley was director firm called grunnings which made drills he was big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have very large mustache mrs dursley was thin blonde had nearly twice usual amount neck which came very useful as she spent so much her time craning over garden fences spying on neighbors dursleys had small son called dudley their opinion was no finer boy anywhere dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had secret their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about potters mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have sister because her sister her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible be dursleys shuddered think what neighbors would say if potters arrived street dursleys knew that potters had small son too but they had never even seen him this boy was another good reason for keeping potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with child like that when mr mrs dursley woke up on dull gray tuesday our story starts was nothing about cloudy sky outside suggest that strange mysterious things would soon be happening all over country mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled screaming dudley into his high chair none them noticed large tawny owl flutter past window at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on cheek tried kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley was now having tantrum throwing his cereal at walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left house he got into his car backed out number fours drive it was on corner street that he noticed first sign something peculiar cat reading map for second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around look again was tabby cat standing on corner privet drive but wasnt map sight what could he have been thinking it must have been trick light mr dursley blinked stared at cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around corner up road he watched cat his mirror it was now reading sign that said privet drive no looking at sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself little shake put cat out his mind as he drove toward town he thought nothing except large order drills he was hoping get that day but on edge town drills were driven out his mind by something else as he sat usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that seemed be lot strangely dressed people about people cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed funny clothes getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on steering wheel his eyes fell on huddle these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley was enraged see that couple them werent young at all why that man had be older than he was wearing an emeraldgreen cloak nerve him but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something yes that would be it traffic moved on few minutes later mr dursley arrived grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills mr dursley always sat with his back window his office on ninth floor if he hadnt he might have found it harder concentrate on drills that morning he didnt see owls swoop ing past broad daylight though people down street did they pointed gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone calls shouted bit more he was very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs walk across road buy himself bun from bakery hed forgotten all about people cloaks until he passed group them next bakers he eyed them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too he couldnt see single collecting tin it was on his way back past them clutching large doughnut bag that he caught few words what they were saying potters thats right thats what heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at whisperers as if he wanted say something them but thought better it he dashed back across road hurried up his office snapped at his secretary not disturb him seized his telephone had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put receiver back down stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid potter wasnt such an unusual name he was sure were lots people called potter who had son called harry come think it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called harry hed never even seen boy it might have been harvey or harold was no point worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention her sister he didnt blame her if hed had sister like that but all same those people cloaks he found it lot harder concentrate on drills that afternoon when he left building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside door sorry he grunted as tiny old man stumbled almost fell it was few seconds before mr dursley realized that man was wearing violet cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked ground on contrary his face split into wide smile he said squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for youknowwho has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day old man hugged mr dursley around middle walked off mr dursley stood rooted spot he had been hugged by complete stranger he also thought he had been called muggle whatever that was he was rattled he hurried his car set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve imagination as he pulled into driveway number four first thing he saw it didnt improve his mood was tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was same one it had same markings around its eyes shoo said mr dursley loudly cat didnt move it just gave him stern look was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying pull himself together he let himself into house he was still determined not mention anything his wife mrs dursley had had nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter how dudley had learned new word wont mr dursley tried act normally when dudley had been put bed he went into living room time catch last report on evening news finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that nations owls have been behaving very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night are hardly ever seen daylight have been hundreds sightings these birds flying every direction since sunrise experts are unable explain why owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern newscaster allowed himself grin most mysterious now over jim mcguffin with weather going be any more showers owls tonight jim well ted said weatherman dont know about that but its not only owls that have been acting oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire dundee have been phoning tell me that instead rain promised yesterday theyve had downpour shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early its not until next week folks but can promise wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen his armchair shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people cloaks all over place whisper whisper about potters mrs dursley came into living room carrying two cups tea it was no good hed have say something her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you havent heard from your sister lately have you as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked angry after all they normally pretended she didnt have sister no she said sharply why funny stuff on news mr dursley mumbled owls shooting stars were lot funnylooking people town today so snapped mrs dursley well just thought maybe it was something do with you know her crowd mrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard name potter he decided he didnt dare instead he said as casually as he could their son hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt he suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly whats his name again howard isnt it harry nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes quite agree he didnt say another word on subject as they went upstairs bed while mrs dursley was bathroom mr dursley crept bedroom window peered down into front garden cat was still it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something was he imagining things could all this have anything do with potters if it did if it got out that they were related pair well he didnt think he could bear it dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if potters were involved was no reason for them come near him mrs dursley potters knew very well what he petunia thought about them their kind he couldnt see how he petunia could get mixed up anything that might be going on he yawned turned over it couldnt affect them how very wrong he was mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but cat on wall outside was showing no sign sleepiness it was sitting as still as statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on far corner privet drive it didnt so much as quiver when car door slammed on next street nor when two owls swooped overhead fact it was nearly midnight before cat moved at all man appeared on corner cat had been watching appeared so suddenly silently youd have thought hed just popped out ground cats tail twitched its eyes narrowed nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he was tall thin very old judging by silver his hair beard which were both long enough tuck into his belt he was wearing long robes purple cloak that swept ground highheeled buckled boots his blue eyes were light bright sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles his nose was very long crooked as though it had been broken at least twice this mans name was albus dumbledore albus dumbledore didnt seem realize that he had just arrived street where everything from his name his boots was unwelcome he was busy rummaging his cloak looking for something but he did seem realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at cat which was still staring at him from other end street for some reason sight cat seemed amuse him he chuckled muttered should have known he found what he was looking for his inside pocket it seemed be silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up air clicked it nearest street lamp went out with little pop he clicked it again next lamp flickered into darkness twelve times he clicked putouter until only lights left on whole street were two tiny pinpricks distance which were eyes cat watching him if anyone looked out their window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able see anything that was happening down on pavement dumbledore slipped putouter back inside his cloak set off down street toward number four where he sat down on wall next cat he didnt look at it but after moment he spoke it fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned smile at tabby but it had gone instead he was smiling at rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly shape markings cat had had around its eyes she too was wearing cloak an emerald one her black hair was drawn into tight bun she looked distinctly ruffled how did you know it was me she asked my dear professor ve never seen cat sit so stiffly youd be stiff if youd been sitting on brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall all day when you could have been celebrating must have passed dozen feasts parties on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily oh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatiently youd think theyd be bit more careful but no even muggles have noticed somethings going on it was on their news she jerked her head back at dursleys dark livingroom window heard it flocks owls shooting stars well theyre not completely stupid they were bound notice something shooting stars down kent ill bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much sense you cant blame them said dumbledore gently weve had precious little celebrate for eleven years know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but thats no reason lose our heads people are being downright careless out on streets broad daylight not even dressed muggle clothes swapping rumors she threw sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going tell her something but he didnt so she went on fine thing it would be if on very day youknowwho seems have disappeared at last muggles found out about us all suppose he really has gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much be thankful for would you care for lemon drop what lemon drop theyre kind muggle sweet im rather fond no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was moment for lemon drops as say even if youknowwho has gone my dear professor surely sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this you knowwho nonsense for eleven years have been trying persuade people call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not notice it all gets so confusing if we keep saying youknowwho have never seen any reason be frightened saying voldemorts name know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre different everyone knows youre only one youknow oh all right voldemort was frightened you flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had powers will never have only because youre too well noble use them its lucky its dark havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shot sharp look at dumbledore said owls are nothing next rumors that are flying around you know what everyones saying about why hes disappeared about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached point she was most anxious discuss real reason she had been waiting on cold hard wall all day for neither as cat nor as woman had she fixed dumbledore with such piercing stare as she did now it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going believe it until dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop did not answer what theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up godrics hollow he went find potters rumor is that lily james potter are are that theyre dead dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gasped lily james cant believe it didnt want believe it oh albus dumbledore reached out patted her on shoulder know know he said heavily professor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on thats not all theyre saying he tried kill potters son harry but he couldnt he couldnt kill that little boy no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke thats why hes gone dumbledore nodded glumly its its true faltered professor mcgonagall after all hes done all people hes killed he couldnt kill little boy its just astounding all things stop him but how name heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out lace handkerchief dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles dumbledore gave great sniff as he took golden watch from his pocket examined it it was very odd watch it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around edge it must have made sense dumbledore though because he put it back his pocket said hagrids late suppose it was he who told you id be here by way yes said professor mcgonagall dont suppose youre going tell me why youre here all places ive come bring harry his aunt uncle theyre only family he has left now you dont mean you cant mean people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping her feet pointing at number four dumbledore you cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt find two people who are less like us theyve got this son saw him kicking his mother all way up street screaming for sweets harry potter come live here its best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt uncle will be able explain everything him when hes older ive written them letter letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this letter these people will never understand him hell be famous legend wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day future will be books written about harry every child our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over top his halfmoon glasses it would be enough turn any boys head famous before he can walk talk famous for something he wont even remember cara you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed then said yes yes youre right course but how is boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it hagrids bringing him you think it wise trust hagrid with something as important as this would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore im not saying his heart isnt right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless he does tend what was that low rumbling sound had broken silence around them it grew steadily louder as they looked up down street for some sign headlight it swelled roar as they both looked up at sky huge motorcycle fell out air landed on road front them if motorcycle was huge it was nothing man sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as normal man at least five times as wide he looked simply too big be allowed so wild long tangles bushy black hair beard hid most his face he had hands size trash can lids his feet their leather boots were like baby dolphins his vast muscular arms he was holding bundle blankets hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it professor dumbledore sit said giant climbing carefully off motorcycle as he spoke young sirius black lent it me ive got him sir no problems were no sir house was almost destroyed but got him out all right before muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol dumbledore professor mcgonagall bent forward over bundle blankets inside just visible was baby boy fast asleep under tuft jetblack hair over his forehead they could see curiously shaped cut like bolt lightning is that where whispered professor mcgonagall yes said dumbledore hell have that scar forever couldnt you do something about it dumbledore even if could wouldnt scars can come handy have one myself above my left knee that is perfect map london underground well give him here hagrid wed better get this over with dumbledore took harry his arms turned toward dursleys house could could say goodbye him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry gave him what must have been very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out howl like wounded dog shhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake muggles sssorry sobbed hagrid taking out large spotted handkerchief burying his face it but cccant stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes its all very sad but get grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on arm as dumbledore stepped over low garden wall walked front door he laid harry gently on doorstep took letter out his cloak tucked it inside harrys blankets then came back other two for full minute three them stood looked at little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed have gone out well said dumbledore finally thats that weve no business staying here we may as well go join celebrations yeah said hagrid very muffled voice ill be takin sirius his bike back gnight professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto motorcycle kicked engine into life with roar it rose into air off into night shall see you soon expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding her professor mcgonagall blew her nose reply dumbledore turned walked back down street on corner he stopped took out silver putouter he clicked it once twelve balls light sped back their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange he could make out tabby cat slinking around corner at other end street he could just see bundle blankets on step number four good luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel with swish his cloak he was gone breeze ruffled neat hedges privet drive which lay silent tidy under inky sky very last place you would expect astonishing things happen harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up one small hand closed on letter beside him he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened front door put out milk bottles nor that he would spend next few weeks being prodded pinched by his cousin dudley he couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting secret all over country were holding up their glasses saying hushed voices harry potter boy who lived chapter two vanishing glass nearly ten years had passed since dursleys had woken up find their nephew on front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all sun rose on same tidy front gardens lit up brass number four on dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly same as it had been on night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about owls only photographs on mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed ten years ago had been lots pictures what looked like large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer baby now photographs showed large blond boy riding his first bicycle on carousel at fair playing computer game with his father being hugged kissed by his mother room held no sign at all that another boy lived house too yet harry potter was still asleep at moment but not for long his aunt petunia was awake it was her shrill voice that made first noise day up get up now harry woke with start his aunt rapped on door again up she screeched harry heard her walking toward kitchen then sound frying pan being put on stove he rolled onto his back tried remember dream he had been having it had been good one had been flying motorcycle it he had funny feeling hed had same dream before his aunt was back outside door are you up yet she demanded nearly said harry well get move on want you look after bacon dont you dare let it burn want everything perfect on duddys birthday harry groaned what did you say his aunt snapped through door nothing nothing dudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out bed started looking for socks he found pair under his bed after pulling spider off one them put them on harry was used spiders because cupboard under stairs was full them that was where he slept when he was dressed he went down hall into kitchen table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents it looked as though dudley had gotten new computer he wanted not mention second television racing bike exactly why dudley wanted racing bike was mystery harry as dudley was very fat hated exercise unless course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it but he was very fast perhaps it had something do with living dark cupboard but harry had always been small skinny for his age he looked even smaller skinnier than he really was because all he had wear were old clothes dudleys dudley was about four times bigger than he was harry had thin face knobbly knees black hair bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with lot scotch tape because all times dudley had punched him on nose only thing harry liked about his own appearance was very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like bolt lightning he had had it as long as he could remember first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it car crash when your parents died she had said dont ask questions dont ask questions that was first rule for quiet life with dursleys uncle vernon entered kitchen as harry was turning over bacon comb your hair he barked by way morning greeting about once week uncle vernon looked over top his newspaper shouted that harry needed haircut harry must have had more haircuts than rest boys his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over place harry was frying eggs by time dudley arrived kitchen with his mother dudley looked lot like uncle vernon he had large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like pig wig harry put plates egg bacon on table which was difficult as wasnt much room dudley meanwhile was counting his presents his face fell thirtysix he said looking up at his mother father thats two less than last year darling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mommy daddy all right thirtyseven then said dudley going red face harry who could see huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible case dudley turned table over aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly well buy you another two presents while were out today hows that popkin two more presents is that all right dudley thought for moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty thirty thirtynine sweetums said aunt petunia oh dudley sat down heavily grabbed nearest parcel all right then uncle vernon chuckled little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hair at that moment telephone rang aunt petunia went answer it while harry uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap racing bike video camera remote control airplane sixteen new computer games vcr he was ripping paper off gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from telephone looking both angry worried bad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head harrys direction dudleys mouth fell open horror but harrys heart gave leap every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him friend out for day adventure parks hamburger restaurants or movies every year harry was left behind with mrs figg mad old lady who lived two streets away harry hated it whole house smelled cabbage mrs figg made him look at photographs all cats shed ever owned now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this harry knew he ought feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be whole year before he had look at tibbles snowy mr paws tufty again we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested dont be silly vernon she hates boy dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like slug what about whatshername your friend yvonne on vacation majorca snapped aunt petunia you could just leave me here harry put hopefully hed be able watch what he wanted on television for change maybe even have go on dudleys computer aunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed lemon come back find house ruins she snarled wont blow up house said harry but they werent listening suppose we could take him zoo said aunt petunia slowly leave him car that cars new hes not sitting it alone dudley began cry loudly fact he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted dinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him dont want him ttto come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs he always sp spoils everything he shot harry nasty grin through gap his mothers arms just then doorbell rang oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked with his mother piers was scrawny boy with face like rat he was usually one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending cry at once half an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting back dursleys car with piers dudley on way zoo for first time his life his aunt uncle hadnt been able think anything else do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry aside im warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close harrys im warning you now boy any funny business anything at all youll be that cupboard from now until christmas im not going do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever did problem was strange things often happened around harry it was just no good telling dursleys he didnt make them happen once aunt petunia tired harry coming back from barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken pair kitchen scissors cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent sleepless night imagining school next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes taped glasses next morning however he had gotten up find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given week his cupboard for this even though he had tried explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly another time aunt petunia had been trying force him into revolting old sweater dudleys brown with orange puff balls harder she tried pull it over his head smaller it seemed become until finally it might have fitted hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk wash his great relief harry wasnt punished on other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on roof school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much harrys surprise as anyone elses he was sitting on chimney dursleys had received very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried do as he shouted at uncle vernon through locked door his cupboard was jump behind big trash cans outside kitchen doors harry supposed that wind must have caught him mid jump but today nothing was going go wrong it was even worth being with dudley piers be spending day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living room while he drove uncle vernon complained aunt petunia he liked complain about things people at work harry council harry bank harry were just few his favorite subjects this morning it was motorcycles roaring along like maniacs young hoodlums he said as motorcycle overtook them had dream about motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it was flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into car front he turned right around his seat yelled at harry his face like gigantic beet with mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley piers sniggered know they dont said harry it was only dream but he wished he hadnt said anything if was one thing dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting way it shouldnt no matter if it was dream or even cartoon they seemed think he might get dangerous ideas it was very sunny saturday zoo was crowded with families dursleys bought dudley piers large chocolate ice creams at entrance then because smiling lady van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him cheap lemon ice pop it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blond harry had best morning hed had long time he was careful walk little way apart from dursleys so that dudley piers who were starting get bored with animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby hitting him they ate zoo restaurant when dudley had tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one harry was allowed finish first harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good last after lunch they went reptile house it was cool dark with lit windows all along walls behind glass all sorts lizards snakes were crawling slithering over bits wood stone dudley piers wanted see huge poisonous cobras thick mancrushing pythons dudley quickly found largest snake place it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car crushed it into trash can but at moment it didnt look mood fact it was fast asleep dudley stood with his nose pressed against glass staring at glistening brown coils make it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on glass but snake didnt budge do it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped glass smartly with his knuckles but snake just snoozed on this is boring dudley moaned he shuffled away harry moved front tank looked intently at snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on glass trying disturb it all day long it was worse than having cupboard as bedroom where only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on door wake you up at least he got visit rest house snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on level with harrys it winked harry stared then he looked quickly around see if anyone was watching they werent he looked back at snake winked too snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon dudley then raised its eyes ceiling it gave harry look that said quite plainly get that all time know harry murmured through glass though he wasnt sure snake could hear him it must be really annoying snake nodded vigorously where do you come from anyway harry asked snake jabbed its tail at little sign next glass harry peered at it boa constrictor brazil was it nice boa constrictor jabbed its tail at sign again harry read on this specimen was bred zoo oh see so youve never been brazil as snake shook its head deafening shout behind harry made both them jump dudley mr dursley come look at this snake you wont believe what its doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could out way you he said punching harry ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers dudley were leaning right up close glass next they had leapt back with howls horror harry sat up gasped glass front boa constrictors tank had vanished great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto floor people throughout reptile house screamed started running for exits as snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn low hissing voice said brazil here come thanksss amigo keeper reptile house was shock but glass he kept saying where did glass go zoo director himself made aunt petunia cup strong sweet tea while he apologized over over again piers dudley could only gibber as far as harry had seen snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by time they were all back uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried squeeze him death but worst all for harry at least was piers calming down enough say harry was talking it werent you harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out house before starting on harry he was so angry he could hardly speak he managed say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into chair aunt petunia had run get him large brandy harry lay his dark cupboard much later wishing he had watch he didnt know what time it

with strange vision blinding flash green light burn ing pain on his forehead this he supposed was crash though he couldnt imagine where all green light came from he couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt uncle never spoke about them course he was forbidden ask questions were no photographs them house when he had been younger harry had dreamed dreamed some unknown relation coming take him away but it had never happened dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers street seemed know him very strange strangers they were too tiny man violet top hat had bowed him once while out shopping with aunt petunia dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew man aunt petunia had rushed them out shop without buying anything wildlooking old woman dressed all green had waved merrily at him once on bus bald man very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand street other day then walked away without word weirdest thing about all these people was way they

school was over but was no escaping dudleys gang who visited house every single day piers dennis malcolm gordon were all big stupid but as dudley was biggest stupidest lot he was leader rest them were

smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers flat straw hats called boaters they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while teachers werent looking this was supposed

cracks around front back doors so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through tulips as he worked jumped at small noises on saturday things began get out hand twentyfour letters harry found their way into house rolled up hidden inside each two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls post office dairy trying find someone complain aunt petunia shredded letters her food processor who on earth wants talk you this badly dudley asked harry amazement on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at breakfast table looking tired rather ill but happy no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down kitchen chimney as he spoke caught him sharply on back head next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out fireplace like bullets dursleys ducked but harry leapt into air trying catch one out out uncle vernon seized harry around waist threw him into hall when aunt petunia dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed door shut they could hear letters still streaming into room bouncing off walls floor that does it said uncle vernon trying speak calmly but pulling great tufts out his mustache at same time want you all back here five minutes ready leave were going away just pack some clothes no arguments he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through boardedup doors were car speeding toward highway dudley was sniffling back seat his father had hit him round head for holding them up while he tried pack his television vcr computer his sports bag they drove they drove even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going every now then uncle vernon would take sharp turn drive opposite direction for while shakeem off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did this they didnt stop eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley was howling hed never had such bad day his life he was hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted see hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer uncle vernon stopped at last outside gloomylooking hotel on outskirts big city dudley harry shared room with twin beds damp musty sheets dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on windowsill staring down at lights passing cars wondering they ate stale cornflakes cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast next day they had just finished when owner hotel came over their table scuse me but is one you mr h potter only got about an undred these at front desk she held up letter so they could read green ink address mr h potter room 17 railview hotel cokeworth harry made grab for letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out way woman stared ill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly following her from dining room wouldnt it be better just

his head got back car off they went again same thing happened middle plowed field halfway across suspension bridge at top multilevel parking garage daddys gone mad hasnt he dudley asked aunt petunia

back he was smiling he was also carrying long thin package didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed bought found perfect place he said come on everyone out it was very cold outside car uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like large rock way out at sea perched on top rock was most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing was certain was no television storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together this gentlemans kindly agreed lend us his boat toothless old man came ambling up them pointing with rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing irongray water below them ive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard it was freezing boat icy sea spray rain crept down their necks chilly wind whipped their faces after what seemed like hours they reached rock where uncle vernon slipping sliding led way brokendown house inside was horrible it smelled strongly seaweed wind whistled through gaps wooden walls fireplace was damp empty were only two rooms uncle vernons rations turned out be bag chips each four bananas he tried start fire but empty chip bags just smoked shriveled up could do with some those letters now eh he said cheerfully he was very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood chance reaching them here storm deliver mail harry privately agreed though thought didnt cheer him up at all as night fell promised storm blew up around them spray from high waves splattered walls hut fierce wind rattled filthy windows aunt petunia found few moldy blankets second room made up bed for dudley on motheaten sofa she uncle vernon went off lumpy bed next door harry was left find softest bit floor he could curl up under thinnest most ragged blanket storm raged more more ferociously as night went on harry couldnt sleep he shivered turned over trying get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned by low rolls thunder that started near midnight lighted dial dudleys watch which was dangling over edge sofa on his fat wrist told harry hed be eleven ten minutes time he lay watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if dursleys would remember at all wondering where letter writer was now five minutes go harry heard something creak outside he hoped roof wasnt going fall although he might be warmer if it did four minutes go maybe house privet drive would be so full letters when they got back that hed be able steal one somehow three minutes go was that sea slapping hard on rock like that two minutes go what was that funny crunching noise was rock crumbling into sea one minute go hed be eleven thirty seconds twenty ten nine maybe hed wake dudley up just annoy him three two one boom whole shack shivered harry sat bolt upright staring at door someone was outside knocking come chapter four keeper keys boom they knocked again dudley jerked awake wheres cannon he said stupidly was crash behind them uncle vernon came skidding into room he was holding rifle his hands now they knew what had been long thin package he had brought with them whos he shouted warn you im armed was pause then smash door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges with deafening crash landed flat on floor giant man was standing doorway his face was almost completely hidden by long shaggy mane hair wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all hair giant squeezed his way into hut stooping so that his head just brushed ceiling he bent down picked up door fitted it easily back into its frame noise storm outside dropped little he turned look at them all couldnt make us cup o tea could yeh its not been an easy journey he strode over sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear budge up yeh great lump said stranger dudley squeaked ran hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernon an heres harry said giant harry looked up into fierce wild shadowy face saw that beetle eyes were

stronger if yehve got it mind his eyes fell on empty grate with shriveled chip bags it he snorted he bent down over fireplace they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back second later was roaring fire it filled whole damp hut with flickering light harry felt warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into hot bath giant sat back down on sofa which sagged under his weight began taking all sorts things out pockets his coat copper kettle squashy package sausages poker teapot several chipped mugs bottle some amber liquid that he took swig from before starting make tea soon hut was full sound smell sizzling sausage nobody said thing while giant was working but as he slid first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from poker dudley fidgeted little uncle vernon said sharply dont touch

close he saw again blinding flash green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before he remembered something else for first time his life high cold cruel laugh hagrid was watching him sadly took yeh from ruined house myself on dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lot load old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that dursleys were uncle vernon certainly

you dursley im warning you one more word danger being speared on end an umbrella by bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against wall fell silent thats better said hagrid breathing heavily sitting back down on sofa which this time sagged right down floor harry meanwhile still had questions ask hundreds them but what happened vol sorry mean youknowwho good

turned into warty toads every time theyd tried lock him his cupboard if hed once defeated greatest sorcerer world how come dudley had always been able kick him around like football hagrid he said quietly think you must have made mistake dont think can be wizard his surprise hagrid chuckled not wizard eh never made things happen when you was scared or angry harry looked into fire now he came think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out their reach dreading going school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed make it grow back very last time dudley had hit him hadnt he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it hadnt he set boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid smiling saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him see said hagrid harry potter not wizard you wait youll be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon

folded up his newspaper they clambered up stone steps onto street passersby stared lot at hagrid as they walked through little town station harry couldnt blame them not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters saying loudly see that harry things these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting bit as he ran keep up did you

used getting an ordinary way he got stuck ticket barrier on underground complained loudly that seats were too small trains too slow dont know how muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed brokendown escalator that led up bustling road lined with shops hagrid was so huge that he parted crowd easily all harry had do was keep close behind him they passed book shops music stores hamburger restaurants cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you magic wand this was just an ordinary street full ordinary people could really be piles wizard gold buried miles beneath them were really shops that sold spell books broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that dursleys had cooked up if harry hadnt known that dursleys had no sense humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldnt help trusting him this is it said hagrid coming halt leaky cauldron its famous place it was tiny grubbylooking pub if hagrid hadnt pointed it out harry wouldnt have noticed it was people hurrying by didnt glance at it their eyes slid from big book shop on one side record shop on other as if they couldnt see leaky cauldron at all fact harry had most peculiar feeling that only he hagrid could see it before he could mention this hagrid had steered him inside for famous place it was very dark shabby few old women were sitting corner drinking tiny glasses sherry one them was smoking long pipe little man top hat was talking old bartender who was quite bald looked like toothless walnut low buzz chatter stopped when they walked everyone seemed know hagrid they waved smiled at him bartender reached for glass saying usual hagrid cant tom im on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder making harrys knees buckle good lord said bartender peering at harry is this can this be leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still silent bless my soul whispered old bartender harry potter what an honor he hurried out from behind bar rushed toward harry seized his hand tears his eyes welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didnt know what say everyone was looking at him

from them all at last hagrid managed make himself heard over babble must get on lots ter buy come on harry doris crockford shook harrys hand one last time hagrid led them through bar out into small walled courtyard where was nothing but trash can few weeds hagrid grinned at harry told yeh didnt told yeh you was famous even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you hes usually tremblin is he always that nervous oh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took year off ter get some firsthand experience they say he met vampires black forest was nasty bit o trouble with hag never been same since scared students scared his own subject now wheres me umbrella vampires hags harrys head was swimming hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks wall above trash can three up two across he muttered right stand back harry he tapped wall three times with point his umbrella brick he had touched quivered it wriggled middle small hole appeared it grew wider wider second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto cobbled street that twisted turned out sight welcome said hagrid diagon alley he grinned at harrys amazement they stepped through archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder saw archway shrink instantly back into solid wall sun shone brightly on stack cauldrons outside nearest shop cauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver selfstirring collapsible said sign hanging over them yeah youll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eyes he turned his head every direction as they walked up street trying look at everything at once shops things outside them people doing their shopping plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver seventeen sickles an ounce theyre mad low soft hooting came from dark shop with sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown snowy several boys about harrys age had their noses pressed against window with broomsticks it look harry heard one them say new nimbus two thousand fastest ever were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels bat spleens eels eyes tottering piles spell books quills rolls parchment potion bottles globes moon gringotts said hagrid they had reached snowy white building that towered over other little shops standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing uniform scarlet gold was yeah thats goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up white stone steps toward him goblin was about head shorter than harry he had swarthy clever face pointed beard harry noticed very long fingers feet he bowed as they walked inside now they were facing second pair doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed what awaits sin greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly their turn so if you seek beneath our floors treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware finding more than treasure like said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid pair goblins bowed them through silver doors they were vast marble hall about hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind long counter scribbling large ledgers weighing coins brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses were too many doors count leading off hall yet more goblins were showing people out these hagrid harry made for counter morning said hagrid free goblin weve come ter take some money outta mr harry potters safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid he started emptying his pockets onto counter scattering handful moldy dog biscuits over goblins book numbers goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched goblin on their right weighing pile rubies as big as glowing coals got it said hagrid at last holding up tiny golden key goblin looked at it closely that seems be order an ive also got letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest its about youknowwhat vault seven hundred thirteen goblin read letter carefully very well he said handing it back hagrid will have someone take you down both vaults griphook griphook was yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed all dog biscuits back inside his pockets he harry followed griphook toward one doors leading off hall whats youknowwhat vault seven hundred thirteen harry asked cant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh that griphook held door open for them harry who had expected more marble was surprised they were narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches it sloped steeply downward were little railway tracks on floor griphook whistled small cart came hurtling up tracks toward them they climbed hagrid with some difficulty were off at first they just hurtled through maze twisting passages harry tried remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible rattling cart seemed know its own way because griphook wasnt steering harrys eyes stung as cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw burst fire at end passage twisted around see if it was dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites stalagmites grew from ceiling floor never know harry called hagrid over noise cart whats difference between stalagmite stalactite stalagmites got an m it said hagrid an don ask me questions just now think im gonna be sick he did look very green when cart stopped at last beside small door passage wall hagrid got out had lean against wall stop his knees from trembling griphook unlocked door lot green smoke came billowing out as it cleared harry gasped inside were mounds gold coins columns silver heaps little bronze knuts all yours smiled hagrid all harrys it was incredible dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much harry cost them keep all time had been small fortune belonging him buried deep under london hagrid helped harry pile some it into bag gold ones are galleons he explained seventeen silver sickles galleon twentynine knuts sickle its easy enough right that should be enough fer couple o terms well keep rest safe for yeh he turned griphook vault seven hundred thirteen now please can we go more slowly one speed only said griphook they were going even deeper now gathering speed air became colder colder as they hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over an underground ravine harry leaned over side try see what was down at dark bottom but hagrid groaned pulled him back by scruff his neck vault seven hundred thirteen had no keyhole stand back said griphook importantly he stroked door gently with one his long fingers it simply melted away if anyone but gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through door trapped said griphook how often do you check see if anyones inside harry asked about once every ten years said griphook with rather nasty grin something really extraordinary had be inside this top security vault harry was sure he leaned forward eagerly expecting see fabulous jewels at very least but at first he thought it was empty then he noticed grubby little package wrapped up brown paper lying on floor hagrid picked it up tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed know what it was but knew better than ask come on back this infernal cart dont talk me on way back its best if keep me mouth shut said hagrid one wild cart ride later they stood blinking sunlight outside gringotts harry didnt know where run first now that he had bag full money he didnt have know how many galleons were pound know that he was holding more money than hed had his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had might as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkins robes for all occasions listen harry would yeh mind if slipped off fer pickmeup leaky cauldron hate them gringotts carts he did still look bit sick so harry entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervous madam malkin was squat smiling witch dressed all mauve hogwarts clear she said when harry started speak got lot here another young man being fitted up just now fact back shop boy with pale pointed face was standing on footstool while second witch pinned up his long black robes madam malkin stood harry on stool next him slipped long robe over his head began pin it right length hello said boy hogwarts too yes said harry my fathers next door buying my books mothers up street looking at wands said boy he had bored

gloomily better hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly theres not single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt slytherin youknowwho was one vol sorry youknowwho was at hogwarts years an years ago said hagrid they bought harrys school books shop called flourish blotts where shelves were stacked ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound leather books size postage stamps covers silk books full peculiar symbols few books with nothing them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild get his hands on some these hagrid almost had drag harry away from curses countercurses bewitch your friends befuddle your enemies with latest revenges hair loss jellylegs tongue tying much much more by professor vindictus viridian was trying find out how curse dudley im

get ter that level hagrid wouldnt let harry buy solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got nice set scales for weighing potion ingredients collapsible brass telescope then they visited apothecary which was fascinating enough make up for its horrible smell mixture bad eggs rotted cabbages barrels slimy stuff stood on floor jars herbs dried roots bright powders lined walls bundles feathers strings fangs snarled claws hung from ceiling while hagrid asked man behind counter for supply some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone galleons each minuscule glitteryblack beetle eyes five knuts scoop outside apothecary hagrid checked harrys list again just yer wand left yeah an still havent got yeh birthday present harry felt himself go red you dont have know dont have tell yeh what ill get yer animal not toad toads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at an don like cats they make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all kids want owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark full rustling flickering jewelbright eyes harry now carried large cage that held beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he couldnt stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell don mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect youve had lotta presents from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wands ollivanders yeh gotta have best wand magic wand this was what harry had been really looking forward last shop was narrow shabby peeling gold letters over door read ollivanders makers fine wands since 382 bc single wand lay on faded purple cushion dusty window tinkling bell rang somewhere depths shop as they stepped inside it was tiny place empty except for single spindly chair that hagrid sat on wait harry felt strangely as though he had entered very strict library he swallowed lot new questions that had just occurred him looked instead at thousands narrow boxes piled neatly right up ceiling for some reason back his neck prickled very dust silence here seemed tingle with some secret magic good afternoon said soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because was loud crunching noise he got quickly off spindly chair an old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through gloom shop hello said harry awkwardly ah yes said man yes yes thought id be seeing you soon harry potter it wasnt question you have your mothers eyes it seems only yesterday she was here herself buying her first wand ten quarter inches long swishy made willow nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eyes were bit creepy your father on other hand favored mahogany wand eleven inches pliable little more power excellent for transfiguration well say your father favored it its really wand that chooses wizard course mr ollivander had come so close that he harry were almost nose nose harry could see himself reflected those misty eyes thats where mr ollivander touched lightning scar on harrys forehead with long white finger im sorry say sold wand that did it he said softly thirteenandahalf inches yew powerful wand very powerful wrong hands well if id known what that wand was going out into world do he shook his head then harrys relief spotted hagrid rubeus rubeus hagrid how nice see you again oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasnt it it was sir yes said hagrid good wand that one but suppose they snapped it half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet ive still got pieces though he added brightly but you dont use them said mr ollivander sharply oh no sit said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid piercing look well now mr potter let me see he pulled long tape measure with silver markings out his pocket which is your wand arm er well im righthanded said harry hold out your arm thats it he measured harry from shoulder finger then wrist elbow shoulder floor knee armpit round his head as he measured he said every ollivander wand has core powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers heartstrings dragons no two ollivander wands are same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite same course you will never get such good results with another wizards wand harry suddenly realized that tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own mr ollivander was flitting around shelves taking down boxes that will do he said tape measure crumpled into heap on floor right then mr potter try this one beechwood dragon heartstring nine inches nice flexible just take it give it wave harry took wand feeling foolish waved it around bit but mr ollivander snatched it out his hand almost at once maple phoenix feather seven inches quite whippy try harry tried but he had hardly raised wand when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander no no here ebony unicorn hair eight half inches springy go on go on try it out harry tried tried he had no idea what mr ollivander was waiting for pile tried wands was mounting higher higher on spindly chair but more wands mr ollivander pulled from shelves happier he seemed become tricky customer eh not worry well find perfect match here somewhere wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly phoenix feather eleven inches nice supple harry took wand he felt sudden warmth his fingers he raised wand above his head brought it swishing down through dusty air stream red gold sparks shot from end like firework throwing dancing spots light on walls hagrid whooped clapped mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well well how curious how very curious he put harrys wand back into its box wrapped it brown paper still muttering curious curious sorry said harry but whats curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare remember every wand ive ever sold mr potter every single wand it so happens that phoenix whose tail feather is your wand gave another feather just one other it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar harry swallowed yes thirteenandahalf inches yew curious indeed how these things happen wand chooses wizard remember think we must expect great things from you mr potter after all he whomustnotbenamed did great things terrible yes but great harry shivered he wasnt sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleons for his wand mr ollivander bowed them from his shop late afternoon sun hung low sky as harry hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through wall back through leaky cauldron now empty harry didnt speak at all as they walked down road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on underground laden as they were with all their funnyshaped packages with snowy owl asleep its cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on shoulder got time fer bite eat before yer train leaves he said he bought harry hamburger they sat down on plastic seats eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehow you all right harry yer very quiet said hagrid harry wasnt sure he could explain hed just had best birthday his life yet he chewed his hamburger trying find words everyone thinks im special he said at last all those people leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivander but dont know anything about magic at all how can they expect great things im famous cant even remember what im famous for dont know what happened when vol sorry mean night my parents died hagrid leaned across table behind wild beard eyebrows he wore very kind smile don you worry harry youll learn fast enough everyone starts at beginning at hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself know its hard yehve been singled out an thats always hard but yehll have

cross its all on yer ticket any problems with dursleys send me letter with yer owl shell know where find me see yeh soon harry train pulled out station harry wanted watch hagrid until he was out sight he rose his seat pressed his nose against window but he blinked hagrid had gone chapter six journey from platform nine threequarters harrys last month with dursleys wasnt fun true dudley was now so scared harry he wouldnt stay same room while aunt petunia uncle vernon didnt shut harry his cupboard force him do anything or shout at him fact they didnt speak him at all half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry it were empty although this was an improvement many ways it did become bit depressing after while harry kept his room with his new owl for company he had decided call her hedwig name he had found history magic his school books were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late into night hedwig swooping out open window as she pleased it was lucky that aunt petunia didnt come vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice every night before he went sleep harry ticked off another day on piece paper he had pinned wall counting down september first on last day august he thought hed better speak his aunt uncle about getting kings cross station next day so he went down living room where they were watching quiz show on television he cleared his throat let them know he was dudley screamed ran from room er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted show he was listening er need be at kings cross tomorrow go hogwarts uncle vernon grunted again would it be all right if you gave me lift grunt harry supposed that meant yes thank you he was about go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke funny way get wizards school train magic

nervous go back sleep he got up pulled on his jeans because he didnt want walk into station his wizards robes hed change on train he checked his hogwarts list yet again make sure he had everything he

into sitting next harry they had set off they reached kings cross at half past ten uncle vernon dumped harrys trunk onto cart wheeled it into station for him harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing platforms with nasty grin on his face well you are boy platform nine platform ten your platform should be somewhere middle but they dont seem have built it yet do they he was quite right course was big plastic number nine over one platform big plastic number ten over one next it middle nothing at all have good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier

because hedwig hed have ask someone he stopped passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine threequarters guard had never heard hogwarts when harry couldnt even tell him what part country it was he started get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for train that left at eleven oclock but guard said wasnt one end guard strode away muttering about time wasters harry was now trying hard not panic according large clock over arrivals board he had ten minutes left get on train hogwarts he had no idea how do it he was stranded middle station with trunk he could hardly lift pocket full wizard money large owl hagrid must have forgotten tell him something you had do like tapping third brick on left get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get out his wand start tapping ticket inspectors stand between platforms nine ten at that moment group people passed just behind him he caught few words what they were saying packed with muggles

cart after them they stopped so did he just near enough hear what they were saying now whats platform number said boys mother nine threequarters piped small girl also redheaded who was holding her

greatest wizard modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat dark wizard grindelwald 1945 for discovery twelve uses dragons blood his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel

you know muggle world people just stay put photos do they what they dont move at all ron sounded amazed weird harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into picture on his card gave him small smile ron was more interested eating frogs than looking at famous witches wizards cards but harry couldnt keep his eyes off them soon he had not only dumbledore morgana but hengist woodcroft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus merlin he finally tore his eyes away from druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose open bag bertie botts every flavor beans you want be careful with those ron warned harry when they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all ordinary ones like chocolate peppermint mar malade but then you can get spinach liver tripe george reckons he had booger flavored one once ron picked up green bean looked at it carefully bit into corner bleaaargh see sprouts they had good time eating every flavor beans harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee

hogwarts robes has anyone seen toad nevilles lost one she said she had bossy sort voice lots bushy brown hair rather large front teeth weve already told him we havent seen it said ron but girl wasnt

get round gringotts but they dont think they took anything thats whats odd course everyone gets scared when something like this happens case youknowwhos behind it harry turned this news over his mind he was starting get prickle fear every time you knowwho was mentioned he supposed this was all part entering magical world but it had been lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying whats your quidditch team ron asked er dont know any harry confessed what ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait its best game world he was off explaining all about four balls positions seven players describing famous games hed been with his brothers broomstick hed like get if he had money he was just taking harry through finer points game when compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt neville toadless boy or hermione granger this time three boys entered harry recognized middle one at once it was pale boy from madam malkins robe shop he was looking at harry with lot more interest than hed shown back diagon alley is it true he said theyre saying all down train that harry potters this compartment so its you is it yes said harry he was looking at other boys both them were thickset looked extremely mean standing on either side pale boy they looked like bodyguards oh this is crabbe this is goyle said pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking my names malfoy draco malfoy ron gave slight cough which might have been hiding snigget draco malfoy looked at him think my names funny do you no need ask who you are my father told me all weasleys have red hair freckles more children than they can afford he turned back harry youll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter you dont want go making friends with wrong sort can help you he held out his hand shake harrys but harry didnt take it think can tell who wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly draco malfoy didnt go red but pink tinge appeared his pale cheeks id be careful if

off on you both harry ron stood up say that again ron said his face as red as his hair oh youre going fight us are you malfoy sneered unless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe goyle were lot bigger than him or ron but we dont feet like leaving do we boys weve eaten all our food you still seem have some goyle reached toward chocolate frogs next ron ron leapt forward but before hed so much as touched goyle goyle let out horrible yell scabbers rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyles knuckle crabbe malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round round howling when scabbets finally flew off hit window all three them disappeared at once perhaps they thought were more rats lurking among sweets or perhaps theyd heard footsteps because second later hermione granger had come what has been going on she said looking at sweets all over floor ron picking up scabbers by his tail think hes been knocked out ron said harry he looked closer at scabbers no dont believe it hes gone back sleep so he had youve met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting diagon alley ive heard his family said ron darkly they were some first come back our side after youknowwho disappeared said theyd been bewitched my dad doesnt believe it he says malfoys father didnt need an excuse go over dark side he turned hermione can we

has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her would you mind leaving while we change all right only came here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up down corridors said hermione sniffy voice youve got dirt on your nose by way did you know ron glared at her as she left harry peered out window it was getting dark he could see mountains forests under deep purple sky train did seem be slowing down he ron took off their jackets pulled on their long black robes rons were bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them voice echoed through train we will be reaching hogwarts five minutes time please leave your luggage on train it will be taken school separately harrys stomach lurched with nerves ron he saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed their pockets with last sweets joined crowd thronging corridor train slowed right down finally stopped people pushed their way toward door out on tiny dark platform harry shivered cold night air then lamp came bobbing over heads students harry heard familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right harry hagrids big hairy face beamed over sea heads cmon follow me any more firs years mind yer step now firs years follow me slipping stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed be steep narrow path it was so dark on either side them that harry thought must be thick trees nobody spoke much neville boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice ye all get yer firs sight o hogwarts sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here was loud oooooh narrow path had opened suddenly onto edge great black take perched atop high mountain on other side its windows sparkling starry sky was vast castle with many turrets towers no moren four boat hagrid called pointing fleet little boats sitting water by shore harry ron were followed into their boat by neville hermione everyone shouted hagrid who had boat himself right then forward fleet little boats moved off all at once gliding across lake which was as smooth as glass everyone was silent staring up at great castle overhead it towered over them as they sailed nearer nearer cliff on which it stood heads down yelled hagrid as first boats reached cliff they all bent their heads little boats carried them through curtain ivy that hid wide opening cliff face they were carried along dark tunnel which seemed be taking them right underneath castle until they reached kind underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks pebbles oy you is this your toad said hagrid who was checking boats as people climbed out them trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands then they clambered up passageway rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right shadow castle they walked up flight stone steps crowded around huge oak front door everyone here you still got yer toad hagrid raised gigantic fist knocked three times on castle door chapter seven sorting hat door swung open at once tall blackhaired witch emeraldgreen robes stood she had very stern face harrys first thought was that this was not someone cross firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid thank you hagrid will take them from here she pulled door wide entrance hall was so big you could have fit whole dursleys house it stone walls were lit with flaming torches like ones at gringotts ceiling was too high make out magnificent marble staircase facing them led upper floors they followed professor mcgonagall across flagged stone floor harry could hear drone hundreds voices from doorway right rest school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed first years into small empty chamber off hall they crowded standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously welcome hogwarts said professor mcgonagall startofterm banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats great hall you will be sorted into your houses sorting is very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have classes with rest your house sleep your house dormitory spend free time your house common room four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw slytherin each house has its own noble history each has produced outstanding witches wizards while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn

ceremony will take place few minutes front rest school suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for moment on nevilles cloak which was fastened under his left ear on rons smudged nose harry nervously tried flatten his hair shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagall please wait quietly she left chamber harry swallowed how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron some sort test think fred said it hurts lot but think he was joking harrys heart gave horrible jolt test front whole school but he didnt know any magic yet what on earth would he have do he hadnt expected something like this moment they arrived he looked around anxiously saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all spells shed learned wondering which one shed need harry tried hard not listen her hed never been more nervous never not even when hed had take school report home dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue he kept his eyes fixed on door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back lead him his doom then something happened that made him jump about foot air several people behind him screamed what he gasped so did people around him about twenty ghosts had just streamed through back wall pearlywhite slightly transparent they glided across room talking one another hardly glancing at first years they seemed be arguing what looked like fat little monk was saying forgive forget say we ought give him second chance my dear friar havent we given peeves all chances he deserves he gives us all bad name you know hes not really even ghost say what are you all doing here ghost wearing ruff tights had suddenly noticed first years nobody answered new students said fat friar smiling around at them about be sorted suppose few people nodded mutely hope see you hufflepuff said friar my old house you know move along now said sharp voice sorting ceremonys about start professor mcgonagall had returned one by one ghosts floated away through opposite wall now form line professor mcgonagall told first years follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned lead harry got into line behind boy with sandy hair with ron behind him they walked out chamber back across hall through pair double doors into great hall harry had never even imagined such strange splendid place it was lit by thousands thousands candles that were floating midair over four long tables where rest students were sitting these tables were laid with glittering golden plates goblets at top hall was another long table where teachers were sitting professor mcgonagall led first years up here so that they came halt line facing other students with teachers behind them hundreds faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns flickering candlelight dotted here among students ghosts shone misty silver mainly avoid all staring eyes harry looked upward saw velvety black ceiling dotted with stars he heard hermione whisper its bewitched look like sky outside read about it hogwarts history it was hard believe was ceiling at all that great hall didnt simply open on heavens harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed fourlegged stool front first years on top stool she put pointed wizards hat this hat was patched frayed extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it house maybe they had try get rabbit out it harry thought wildly that seemed sort thing noticing that everyone hall was now staring at hat he stared at it too for few seconds was complete silence then hat twitched rip near brim opened wide like mouth hat began sing oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find smarter hat than me you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek tall for im hogwarts sorting hat can cap them all theres nothing hidden your head sorting hat cant see so try me on will tell you where you ought be you might belong gryffindor where dwell brave at heart their daring nerve chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong hufflepuff where they are just loyal those patient hufflepuffis are true unafraid toil or yet wise old ravenclaw if youve ready mind where those wit learning will always find their kind or perhaps slytherin youll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means achieve their ends so put me on dont be afraid dont get flap youre safe hands though have none for im thinking cap whole hall burst into applause as hat finished its song it bowed each four tables then became quite still again so weve just got try on hat ron whispered harry ill kill fred he was going on about wrestling troll harry smiled weakly yes trying on hat was lot better than having do spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching hat seemed be asking rather alot harry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any it at moment if only hat had mentioned house for people who felt bit queasy that would have been one for him professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding long roll parchment when call your name you will put on hat sit on stool be sorted she said abbott hannah pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out line put on hat which fell right down over her eyes sat down moments pause hufflepuff shouted hat table on right cheered clapped as hannah went sit down at hufflepuff table harry saw ghost fat friar waving merrily at her bones susan hufflepuff shouted hat again susan scuttled off sit next hannah boot terry ravenclaw table second from left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up shake hands with terry as he joined them brocklehurst mandy went ravenclaw too but brown lavender became first new gryffindor table on far left exploded with cheers harry could see rons twin brothers catcalling bulstrode millicent then became slytherin perhaps it was harrys imagination after all hed heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot he was starting feel definitely sick now he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school he had always been last be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley think they liked him finchfletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed hat shouted out house at once but at others it took little while decide finnigan seamus sandyhaired boy next harry line sat on stool for almost whole minute before hat declared him gryffindor granger hermione hermione almost ran stool jammed hat eagerly on her head gryffindor shouted hat ron groaned horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when youre very nervous what if he wasnt chosen at all what if he just sat with hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head said had obviously been mistake hed better get back on train when neville longbottom boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way stool hat took long time decide with neville when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it had jog back amid gales laughter give it macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called got his wish at once hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin malfoy went join his friends crabbe goyle looking pleased with himself werent many people left now moon nott parkinson then pair twin girls patil patil then perks sallyanne then at last potter harry as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over hall potter did she say harry potter last thing harry saw before hat dropped over his eyes was hall full people craning get good look at him next second he was looking at black inside hat he waited hmm said small voice his ear difficult very difficult plenty courage see not bad mind either theres talent my goodness yes nice thirst prove yourself now thats interesting so where shall put you harry gripped edges stool thought not slytherin not slytherin not slytherin eh said small voice are you sure you could be great you know its all here your head slytherin will help you on way greatness no doubt about that no well if youre sure better be gryffindor harry heard hat shout last word whole hall he took off hat walked shakily toward gryffindor table he was so relieved have been chosen not put slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting loudest cheer yet percy prefect got up shook his hand vigorously while weasley twins yelled we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite ghost ruff hed seen earlier ghost patted his arm giving harry sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged it into bucket icecold water he could see high table properly now at end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye gave him thumbs up harry grinned back center high table large gold chair sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once from card hed gotten out chocolate

large purple turban now were only three people left be sorted thomas dean black boy even taller than ron joined harry at gryffindor table turpin lisa became ravenclaw then it was rons turn he was pale green by now harry crossed his fingers under table second later hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with rest as ron collapsed into chair next him well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll took sorting hat away harry looked down at his empty gold plate he had only just realized how hungry he was pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago albus dumbledore had gotten his feet he was beaming at students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than see them all welcome he said welcome new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet would like say few words here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank you he sat back down everybody clapped cheered harry didnt know whether laugh or not is he bit mad he asked percy uncertainly mad said percy airily hes genius best wizard world but he is bit mad yes potatoes harry harrys mouth fell open dishes front him

stiffly but sandyhaired seamus finnigan interrupted nearly headless how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt going at all way he wanted like this he said irritably he seized his left ear pulled his whole head swung off his neck fell onto his shoulder as if it was on hinge someone had obviously tried behead him but not done it properly looking pleased at stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed said so new gryffindors hope youre going help us win house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got cup six years row bloody barons becoming almost unbearable hes slytherin ghost harry looked over at slytherin table saw horrible ghost sitting with blank staring eyes gaunt face robes stained with silver blood he was right next malfoy who harry was pleased see didnt look too pleased with seating arrangements how did he get covered blood asked seamus with great interest ive never asked said nearly headless nick delicately when everyone had eaten as much as they could remains food faded from plates leaving them sparkling clean as before moment later desserts appeared blocks ice cream every flavor you could think apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jello rice pudding as harry helped himself treacle tart talk turned their families im halfandhalf said seamus me dads muggle mom didnt tell him she was witch til after they were married bit nasty shock for him others laughed

dumbledore professor quirrell his absurd turban was talking teacher with greasy black hair hooked nose sallow skin it happened very suddenly hooknosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes sharp hot pain shot across scar on harrys forehead ouch harry clapped hand his head what is it asked percy nnothing pain had gone as quickly as it had come harder shake off was

give you first years should note that forest on grounds is forbidden all pupils few our older students would do well remember that as well dumbledores twinkling eyes flashed direction weasley twins have also been asked by mr filch caretaker remind you all that no magic should be used between classes corridors quidditch trials will be held second week term anyone interested playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch finally must tell you that this year thirdfloor corridor on righthand side is out bounds everyone who does not wish die very painful death harry laughed but he was one few who did hes not serious he muttered percy must be said percy frowning at dumbledore its odd because he usually gives us reason why were not allowed go somewhere forests full dangerous beasts everyone knows that do think he might have told us prefects at least now before we go bed let us sing school song cried dumbledore harry noticed that other teachers smiles had become rather fixed dumbledore gave his wand little flick as if he was trying get fly off end long golden ribbon flew out it which rose high above tables twisted itself snakelike into words everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore off we go school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now theyre bare full air dead flies bits fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what weve forgot just do your best well do rest learn until our brains all rot everybody finished song at different times at last only weasley twins were left singing along very slow funeral march dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand when they had finished he was one those who clapped loudest ah music he said wiping his eyes magic beyond all we do here now bedtime off you trot gryffindor first years followed percy through chattering crowds out great hall up marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired full food he was too sleepy even be surprised that people portraits along corridors whispered pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels hanging tapestries they climbed more staircases yawning dragging their feet harry was just wondering how much farther they had go when they came sudden halt bundle walking sticks was floating midair ahead them as percy took step toward them they started throwing themselves at him peeves percy whispered first years poltergeist he raised his voice peeves show yourself loud rude sound like air being let out balloon answered do you want me go bloody baron was pop little man with wicked dark eyes wide mouth appeared floating cross legged air clutching walking sticks oooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what fun he swooped suddenly at them they all ducked go away peeves or baronll hear about this mean it barked percy peeves stuck out his tongue vanished dropping walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coats armor as he passed you want watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again bloody barons only one who can control him he wont even listen us prefects here we are at very end corridor hung portrait very fat woman pink silk dress password she said caput draconis said percy portrait swung forward reveal round hole wall they all scrambled through it neville needed leg up found themselves gryffindor common room cozy round room full squashy armchairs percy directed girls through one door their dormitory boys through another at top spiral staircase they were obviously one towers they found their beds at last five fourposters hung with deep red velvet curtains their trunks had already been brought up too tired talk much they pulled on their pajamas fell into bed great food isnt it ron muttered harry through hangings get off scabbers hes chewing my sheets harry was going ask ron if hed had any treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once perhaps harry had eaten bit too much because he had very strange dream he was wearing professor quirrells turban which kept talking him telling him he must transfer slytherin at once because it was his destiny harry told turban he didnt want be slytherin it got heavier heavier he tried pull it off but it tightened painfully was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into hooknosed teacher snape whose laugh became high cold was burst green light harry woke sweating shaking he rolled over fell asleep again when he woke next day he didnt remember dream at all chapter eight potions master look where next tall kid with red hair wearing glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from moment he left his dormitory next day people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe get look at him or doubled back pass him corridors again staring harry wished they wouldnt because he was trying concentrate on finding his way classes were hundred fortytwo staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on friday some with vanishing step halfway up that you had remember jump then were doors that wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled them exactly right place doors that werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending it was also very hard remember where anything was because it all seemed move around lot people portraits kept going visit each other harry was sure coats armor could walk ghosts didnt help either it was always nasty shock when one them glided suddenly through door you were trying open nearly headless nick was always happy point new gryffindors right direction but peeves poltergeist was worth two locked doors trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose screech got your conk even worse than peeves if that was possible was caretaker argus filch harry ron managed get on wrong side him on their very first morning filch found them trying force their way through door that unluckily turned out be entrance outofbounds corridor on third floor he wouldnt believe they were lost was sure they were trying break into it on purpose was threatening lock them dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing filch owned cat called mrs norris scrawny dustcolored creature with bulging lamp like eyes just like filchs she patrolled corridors alone break rule front her put just one toe out line shed whisk off for filch whod appear wheezing two seconds later filch knew secret passageways school better than anyone except perhaps weasley twins could pop up as suddenly as any ghosts students all hated him it was dearest ambition many give mrs norris good kick then once you had managed find them were classes themselves was lot more magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand saying few funny words they had study night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight learn names different stars movements planets three times week they went out greenhouses behind castle study herbology with dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how take care all strange plants fungi found out what they were used for easily most boring class was history magic which was only one taught by ghost professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep front staff room fire got up next morning teach leaving his body behind him binns droned on on while they scribbled down names dates got emetic evil uric oddball mixed up professor flitwick charms teacher was tiny little wizard who had stand on pile books see over his desk at start their first class he took roll call when he reached harrys name he gave an excited squeak toppled out sight professor mcgonagall was again different harry had been quite right think she wasnt teacher cross strict clever she gave them talkingto moment they sat down her first class transfiguration is some most complex dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said anyone messing around my class will leave not come back you have been warned then she changed her desk into pig back again they were all very impressed couldnt wait get started but soon realized they werent going be changing furniture into animals for long time after taking lot complicated notes they were each given match started trying turn it into needle by end lesson only hermione granger had made any difference her match professor mcgonagall showed class how it had gone all silver pointy gave hermione rare smile class everyone had really been looking forward was defense against dark arts but quirrells lessons turned out be bit joke his classroom smelled strongly garlic which everyone said was ward off vampire hed met romania was afraid would be coming back get him one these days his turban he told them had been given him by an african prince as thankyou for getting rid troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this story for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly hear how quirrell had fought off zombie quirrell went pink started talking about weather for another they had noticed that funny smell hung around turban weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he went harry was very relieved find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone else lots people had come from muggle families like him hadnt had any idea that they were witches wizards was so much learn that even people like ron didnt have much head start friday was an important day for harry ron they finally managed find their way down great hall for breakfast without getting lost once what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge double potions with slytherins said ron snapes head slytherin house they say he always favors them well be able see if its true wish mcgonagall favored us said harry professor mcgonagall was head gryffindor house but it hadnt stopped her from giving them huge pile homework day before just then mail arrived harry had gotten used this by now but it had given him bit shock on first morning when about hundred owls had suddenly streamed into great hall during breakfast circling tables until they saw their owners dropping letters packages onto their laps hedwig hadnt brought harry anything so far she sometimes flew nibble his ear have bit toast before going off sleep owlery with other school owls this morning however she fluttered down between marmalade sugar bowl dropped note onto harrys plate harry tore it open at once it said very untidy scrawl dear harry know you get friday afternoons off so would you like come have cup tea with me around three want hear all about your first week send us an answer back with hedwig hagrid harry borrowed rons quill scribbled yes please see you later on back note sent hedwig off again it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid look forward because potions lesson turned out be worst thing that had happened him so far at startofterm banquet harry had gotten idea that professor snape disliked him by end first potions lesson he knew hed been wrong snape didnt dislike harry he hated him potions lessons took place down one dungeons it was colder here than up main castle would have been quite creepy enough without pickled animals floating glass jars all around walls snape like flitwick started class by taking roll call like flitwick he paused at harrys name ah yes he said softly harry potter our new celebrity draco malfoy his friends crabbe goyle sniggered behind their hands snape finished calling names looked up at class his eyes were black like hagrids but they had none hagrids warmth they were cold empty made you think dark tunnels you are here learn subtle science exact art potionmaking he began he spoke barely more than whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had y caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had gift keeping class silent without effort as is little foolish wandwaving here many you will hardly believe this is magic dont expect you will really understand beauty softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes delicate power liquids that creep through human veins bewitching mind ensnaring senses can teach you how bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you arent as big bunch dunderheads as usually have teach more silence followed this little speech harry ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows hermione granger was on edge her seat looked desperate start proving that she wasnt dunderhead potter said snape suddenly what would get if added powdered root asphodel an infusion wormwood powdered root what an infusion what harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermiones hand had shot into air dont know sit said harry snapes lips curled into sneer tut tut fame clearly isnt everything he ignored hermiones hand lets try again potter where would you look if told you find me bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didnt have faintest idea what bezoar was he tried not look at malfoy crabbe goyle who were shaking with laughter dont know sit thought you wouldnt open book before coming eh potter harry forced himself keep looking straight into those cold eyes he had looked through his books at dursleys but did snape expect him remember everything one thousand magical herbs fungi snape was still ignoring hermiones quivering hand what is difference potter between monkshood wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward dungeon ceiling dont know said harry quietly think hermione does though why dont you try her few people laughed harry caught seamuss eye seamus winked snape however was not pleased sit down he snapped at hermione for your information potter asphodel wormwood make sleeping potion so powerful it is known as draught living death bezoar is stone taken from stomach goat it will save you from most poisons as for monkshood wolfsbane they are same plant which also goes by name aconite well why arent you all copying that down was sudden rummaging for quills parchment over noise snape said point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didnt improve for gryffindors as potions lesson continued snape put them all into pairs set them mixing up simple potion cure boils he swept around his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed like he was just telling everyone look at perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds acid green smoke loud hissing filled dungeon neville had somehow managed melt seamuss cauldron into twisted blob their potion was seeping across stone floor burning holes peoples shoes within seconds whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched potion when cauldron collapsed moaned pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms legs idiot boy snarled snape clearing spilled potion away with one wave his wand suppose you added porcupine quills before taking cauldron off fire neville whimpered as boils started pop up all over his nose take him up hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he rounded on harry ron who had been working next neville you potter why didnt you tell him not add quills thought hed make you look good if he got it wrong did you thats another point youve lost for gryffindor this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron doi push it he muttered ive heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed steps out dungeon an hour later harrys mind was racing his spirits were low hed lost two points for gryffindor his very first week why did snape hate him so much cheer up said ron snapes always taking points off fred george can come meet hagrid with you at five three they left castle made their way across grounds hagrid lived small wooden house on edge forbidden forest crossbow pair galoshes were outside front door when harry knocked they heard frantic scrabbling from inside several booming barks then hagrids voice rang out saying back fang back hagrids big hairy face appeared crack as he pulled door open hang on he said back fang he let them struggling keep hold on collar an enormous black boarhound was only one room inside hams pheasants were hanging from ceiling copper kettle was boiling on open fire corner stood massive bed with patchwork quilt over it make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go fang who bounded straight at ron started licking his ears like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked this is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into large teapot putting rock cakes onto plate another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at rons freckles spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from forest rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry ron pretended be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons fang rested his head on harrys knee drooled all over his robes harry ron were delighted hear hagrid call fitch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris id like ter introduce her fang sometime dyeh know every time go up ter school she follows me everywhere cant get rid her fitch puts her up it harry told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron told harry not worry about it that snape liked hardly any students but he seemed really hate me rubbish said hagrid why should he yet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes when he said that hows yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron liked him lot great with animals harry wondered if hagrid had changed subject on purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with dragons harry picked up piece paper that was lying on table under tea cozy it was cutting from daily prophet gringotts breakin latest investigations continue into breakin at gringotts on 31 july widely believed be work dark wizards or witches unknown gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken vault that was searched had fact been emptied same day but were not telling you what was so keep your noses out if you know whats good for you said gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon harry remembered ron telling him on train that someone had tried rob gringotts but ron hadnt mentioned date hagrid said harry that gringotts breakin happened on my birthday it mightve been happening while we were was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didnt meet harrys eyes this time he grunted offered him another rock cake harry read story again vault that was searched had fact been emptied earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package had that been what thieves were looking for as harry ron walked back castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite refuse harry thought that none lessons hed had so far had given him as much think about as tea with hagrid had hagrid collected that package just time where was it now did hagrid know something about snape that he didnt want tell harry chapter nine midnight duel harry had never believed he would meet boy he hated more than dudley but that was before he met draco malfoy still firstyear gryffindors only had potions with slytherins so they didnt have put up with malfoy much or at least they didnt until they spotted notice pinned up gryffindor common room that made them all groan flying lessons would be starting on thursday gryffindor slytherin would be learning together typical said harry darkly just what always wanted make fool myself on broomstick front malfoy he had been looking forward learning fly more than anything else you dont know that youll make fool yourself said ron reasonably anyway know malfoys always going on about how good he is at quidditch but bet thats all talk malfay certainly did talk about flying lot he complained loudly about first years never getting on house quidditch teams told long boastful stories that always seemed end with him narrowly escaping muggles helicopters he wasnt only one though way seamus finnigan told it hed spent most his childhood zooming around countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone whod listen about time hed almost hit hang glider on charlies old broom everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly ron had already had big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ron couldnt see what was exciting about game with only one ball where no one was allowed fly harry had caught ron prodding deans poster west ham soccer team trying make players move neville had never been on broomstick his life because his grandmother had never let him near one privately harry felt shed had good reason because neville managed have an extraordinary number accidents even with both feet on ground hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was this was something you couldnt learn by heart out book not that she hadnt tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out library book called quidditch through ages neville was hanging on her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermiones lecture was interrupted by arrival mail harry hadnt had single letter since hagrids note something that malfoy had been quick notice course malfoys eagle owl was always bringing him packages sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at slytherin table barn owl brought neville small package from his grandmother he opened it excitedly showed them glass ball size large marble which seemed be full white smoke its remembrall he explained gran knows forget things this tells you if theres something youve forgotten do look you hold it tight like this if it turns red oh his face fell because remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet youve forgotten something neville was trying remember what hed forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing gryffindor table snatched remembrall out his hand harry ron jumped their feet they were half hoping for reason fight malfay but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher school was flash whats going on malfoys got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped remembrall back on table just looking he said he sloped away with crabbe goyle behind him at threethirty that afternoon harry ron other gryffindors hurried down front steps onto grounds for their first flying lesson it was clear breezy day grass rippled under their feet as they marched down sloping lawns toward smooth flat lawn on opposite side grounds forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly distance slytherins were already so were twenty broomsticks lying neat lines on ground harry had heard fred george weasley complain about school brooms saying that some them started vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly left their teacher madam hooch arrived she had short gray hair yellow eyes like hawk well what are you all waiting for she barked everyone stand by broomstick come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom it was old some twigs stuck out at odd angles stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at front say up upf everyone shouted harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one few that did hermione grangers had simply rolled over on ground nevilles hadnt moved at all perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry was quaver nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted keep his feet on ground madam hooch then showed them how mount their brooms without sliding off end walked up down rows correcting their grips harry ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been doing it wrong for years now when blow my whistle you kick off from ground hard said madam hooch keep your brooms steady rise few feet then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle three two but neville nervous jumpy frightened being left on ground pushed off hard before whistle had touched madam hoochs lips come back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like cork shot out bottle twelve feet twenty feet harry saw his scared white face look down at ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off broom wham thud nasty crack neville lay facedown on grass heap his broomstick was still rising higher higher started drift lazily toward forbidden forest out sight madam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as his broken wrist harry heard her mutter come on boy its all right up you get she turned rest class none you is move while take this boy hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are or youll be out hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him no sooner were they out earshot than malfoy burst into laughter did you see his face great lump other slytherins joined shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson hardfaced slytherin girl never thought youd like fat little crybabies parvati look said malfoy darting forward snatching something out grass its that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent him remembrall glittered sun as he held it up give that here malfoy said harry quietly everyone stopped talking watch malfoy smiled nastily think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom find how about up tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick taken off he hadnt been lying he could fly well hovering level with topmost branches an oak he called come get it potter harry grabbed his broom no shouted hermione granger madam hooch told us not move youll get us all into trouble harry ignored her blood was pounding his ears he mounted broom kicked hard against ground up up he soared air rushed through his hair his robes whipped out behind him rush fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful he pulled his broomstick up little take it even higher heard screams gasps girls back on ground an admiring whoop from ron he turned his broomstick sharply face malfoy midair malfoy looked stunned give it here harry called or ill knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying sneer but looking worried harry knew somehow what do he leaned forward grasped broom tightly both hands it shot toward malfay like javelin malfoy only just got out way time harry made sharp aboutface held broom steady few people below were clapping no crabbe goyle up here save your neck malfoy harry called same thought seemed have struck malfoy catch it if you can then he shouted he threw glass ball high into air streaked back toward ground harry saw as though slow motion ball rise up air then start fall he leaned forward pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed steep dive racing ball wind whistled his ears mingled with screams people watching he stretched out his hand foot from ground he caught it just time pull his broom straight he toppled gently onto grass with remembrall clutched safely his fist harry potter his heart sank faster than hed just dived professor mcgonagall was running toward them he got his feet trembling never all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasnt his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy thats enough mr weasley potter follow me now harry caught sight malfoy crabbe goyles triumphant faces as he left walking numbly professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward castle he was going be expelled he just knew it he wanted say something defend himself but seemed be something wrong with his voice professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had jog keep up now hed done it he hadnt even lasted two weeks hed be packing his bags ten minutes what would dursleys say when he turned up on doorstep up front steps up marble staircase inside still professor mcgonagall didnt say word him she wrenched open doors marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her maybe she was taking him dumbledore he thought hagrid expelled but allowed stay on as gamekeeper perhaps he could be hagrids assistant his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron others becoming wizards while he stumped around grounds carrying hagrids bag professor mcgonagall stopped outside classroom she opened door poked her head inside excuse me professor flitwick could borrow wood for moment wood thought harry bewildered was wood cane she was going use on him but wood turned out be person burly fifthyear boy who came out flitwicles class looking confused follow me you two said professor mcgonagall they marched on up corridor wood looking curiously at harry here professor mcgonagall pointed them into classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on blackboard out peeves she barked peeves threw chalk into bin which clanged loudly he swooped out cursing professor mcgonagall slammed door behind him turned face two boys potter this is oliver wood wood ive found you seeker woods expression changed from puzzlement delight are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply boys natural ive never seen anything like it was that your first time on broomstick potter harry nodded silently he didnt have clue what was going on but he didnt seem be being expelled some feeling started coming back his legs he caught that thing his hand after fiftyfoot dive professor mcgonagall told wood didnt even scratch himself charlie weasley couldnt have done it wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once ever seen game quidditch potter he asked excitedly woods captain gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained hes just build for seeker too said wood now walking around harry staring at him light speedy well have get him decent broom professor nimbus two thousand or cleansweep seven id say shall speak professor dumbledore see if we cant bend firstyear rule heaven knows we need better team than last year flattened that last match by slytherin couldnt look severus snape face for weeks professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry want hear youre training hard potter or may change my mind about punishing you then she suddenly smiled your father would have been proud she said he was an excellent quidditch player himself youre joking it was dinnertime harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when hed left grounds with professor mcgonagall ron had piece steak kidney pie halfway his mouth but hed forgotten all about it seeker he said but first years never you must be youngest house player about century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth he felt particularly hungry after excitement afternoon wood told me ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat gaped at harry start training next week said harry only dont tell anyone wood wants keep it secret fred george weasley now came into hall spotted harry hurried over well done said george low voice wood told us were on team too beaters tell you were going win that quidditch cup for sure this

found new secret passageway out school bet its that one behind statue gregory smarmy that we found our first week see you fred george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe goyle having last meal potter when are you getting train back muggles youre lot braver now that youre back on ground youve got your little friends with you said harry coolly was course nothing at all little about crabbe goyle but as high table was full teachers neither them could do more than crack their knuckles scowl id take you on anytime on my own said malfoy tonight if you want wizards duel wands only no contact whats matter never heard wizards duel before suppose course he has said ron wheeling around im his second whos yours malfoy looked at crabbe goyle sizing them up crabbe he said midnight all right well meet you trophy room thats always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron harry looked at each other what is wizards duel said harry what do you mean youre my second well seconds take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie catching look on harrys face he added quickly but people only die proper duels you know with real wizards most you malfoyll be able do is send sparks at each other neither you knows enough magic do any real damage bet he expected you refuse anyway what if wave my wand nothing happens throw it away punch him on nose ron suggested excuse me they both looked up it was hermione granger cant person eat peace this place said ron hermione ignored him spoke harry couldnt help overhearing what you malfoy were saying bet you could ron muttered you mustnt go wandering around school at night think points youll lose gryffindor if youre caught youre bound be its really very selfish you its really none your business said harry goodbye said ron all same it wasnt what youd call perfect end day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening dean seamus falling asleep neville wasnt back from hospital wing ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries curse you youd better dodge it because cant remember how block them was very good chance they were going get caught by filch or mrs norris harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another school rule today on other hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out darkness this was his big chance beat malfoy facetoface he couldnt miss it halfpast eleven ron muttered at last wed better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands crept across tower room down spiral staircase into gryffindor common room few embers were still glowing fireplace turning all armchairs into hunched black shadows they had almost reached portrait hole when voice spoke from chair nearest them cant believe youre going do this harry lamp flickered on it was hermione granger wearing pink bathrobe frown you said ron furiously go back bed almost told your brother hermione snapped percy hes prefect hed put stop this harry couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering come on he said ron he pushed open portrait fat lady climbed through hole hermione wasnt going give up that easily she followed ron through portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose dont you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves dont want slytherin win house cup youll lose all points got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells go away all right but warned you you just remember what said when youre on train home tomorrow youre so but what they were they didnt find out hermione had turned

wait for filch catch me if he finds all three us ill tell him truth that was trying stop you you can back me up youve got some nerve said ron loudly shut up both you said harry sharply heard something it was sort snuffling mrs norris breathed ron squinting through dark it wasnt mrs norris it was neville he was curled up on floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer thank goodness you found me ive been out here for hours couldnt remember new password get bed keep your voice down neville passwords pig snout but it wont help you now fat ladys gone off somewhere hows your

bogies quirrell told us about used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps tell ron exactly how use curse bogies but harry hissed at her be quiet beckoned them all forward they flitted along corridors striped with bars moonlight from high windows at every turn harry expected run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky they sped up staircase third floor tiptoed toward trophy room malfoy crabbe werent yet crystal trophy cases glimmered where moonlight caught them cups shields plates statues winked silver gold darkness they edged along walls keeping their eyes on doors at either end room harry took out his wand case malfoy leapt started at once minutes crept by hes late maybe hes chickened out ron whispered then noise next room made them jump harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak it wasnt malfoy sniff around my sweet they might be lurking corner it was filch speaking mrs norris horrorstruck harry waved madly at other three follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward door away from filchs voice nevilles robes had barely whipped round corner when they heard filch enter trophy room theyre here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed others petrified they began creep down long gallery full suits armor they could hear filch getting nearer neville suddenly let out frightened squeak broke into run he tripped grabbed ron around waist pair them toppled right into suit armor clanging crashing were enough wake whole castle run harry yelled four them sprinted down gallery not looking back see whether filch was following they swung around doorpost galloped down one corridor then another harry lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through tapestry found themselves hidden passageway hurtled along it came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from trophy room think weve lost him harry panted leaning against cold wall wiping his forehead neville was bent double wheezing spluttering told you hermione gasped clutching at stitch her chest told you weve got get back gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible malfoy tricked you hermione said harry you realize that dont you he was never going meet you filch knew someone was going be trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going tell her that lets go it wasnt going be that simple they hadnt gone more than dozen paces when doorknob rattled something came shooting out classroom front them it was peeves he

neville had been tugging on sleeve harrys bathrobe for last minute what harry turned around saw quite clearly what for moment he was sure hed walked into nightmare this was too much on top everything that had happened so far they werent room as he had supposed they were corridor forbidden corridor on third floor now they knew why it was forbidden they were looking straight into eyes monstrous dog dog that filled whole space between ceiling floor it had three heads three pairs rolling mad eyes three noses twitching quivering their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging slippery ropes from yellowish fangs it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them harry knew that only reason they werent already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant harry groped for doorknob between filch death hed take filch they fell backward harry slammed door shut they ran they almost flew back down corridor filch must have hurried off look for them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted do was put as much space as possible between them that monster they didnt stop running until they reached portrait fat lady on seventh floor where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders their flushed sweaty faces never mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry portrait swung forward they scrambled into common room collapsed trembling into armchairs it was while before any them said anything neville indeed looked as if hed never speak again what do they think theyre doing keeping thing like that locked up school said ron finally if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath her bad temper back again you dont use your eyes any you do you she snapped didnt you see what it was standing on floor harry suggested wasnt looking at its feet was too busy with its heads no not floor it was standing on trapdoor its obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed or worse expelled now if you dont mind im going bed ron stared after her his mouth open no we dont mind he said youd think we dragged her along wouldnt you but hermione had given harry something else think about as he climbed back into bed dog was guarding something what had hagrid said gringotts was safest place world for something you wanted hide except perhaps hogwarts it looked as though harry had found out where grubby littie package from vault seven hundred thirteen was chapter ten halloween malfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that harry ron were still at hogwarts next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful indeed by next morning harry ron thought that meeting threeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure they were quite keen have another one meantime harry filled ron about package that seemed have been moved from gringotts hogwarts they spent lot time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection its either really valuable or really dangerous said ron or both said harry but as all they knew for sure about mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they didnt have much chance guessing what it was without further clues neither neville nor hermione showed slightest interest what lay underneath dog trapdoor all neville cared about was never going near dog again hermione was now refusing speak harry ron but she was such bossy knowitall that they saw this as an added bonus all they really wanted now was way getting back at malfoy their great delight just such thing arrived mail about week later as owls flooded into great hall as usual everyones attention was caught at once by long thin package carried by six large screech owls harry was just as interested as everyone else see what was this large parcel was amazed when owls soared down dropped it right front him knocking his bacon floor they had hardly fluttered out way when another owl dropped letter on top parcel harry ripped open letter first which was lucky because it said do not open parcel at table it contains your new nimbus two thousand but dont want everybody knowing youve got broomstick or theyll all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training session professor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed note ron read nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously ive never even touched one they left hall quickly wanting unwrap broomstick private before their first class but halfway across entrance hall they found way upstairs barred by crabbe goyle malfoy seized package from harry felt it thats broomstick he said throwing it back harry with mixture jealousy spite on his face youll be for it this time potter first years arent allowed them ron couldnt resist it its not any old broomstick he said its nimbus two thousand what did you say youve got at home malfoy comet two sixty ron grinned at harry comets look flashy but theyre not same league as nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldnt afford half handle malfoy snapped back suppose you your brothers have save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoys elbow not arguing hope boys he squeaked potters been sent broomstick professor said malfoy quickly yes yes thats right said professor flitwick beaming at harry professor mcgonagall told me all about special circumstances potter what model is it nimbus two thousand sit said harry fighting not laugh at look horror on malfoys face its really thanks malfoy here that ive got it he added harry ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage confusion well its true harry chortled as they reached top marble staircase if he hadnt stolen nevilles remembrall woulnt be on team so suppose you think thats reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them hermione was stomping up stairs looking disapprovingly at package harrys hand thought you werent speaking us said harry yes dont stop now said ron its doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose air harry had lot trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day it kept wandering up dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off quidditch field where hed be learning play that night he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating then rushed upstairs with ron unwrap nimbus two thousand at last wow ron sighed as broomstick rolled onto harrys bedspread even harry who knew nothing about different brooms thought it looked wonderful sleek shiny with mahogany handle it had long tail neat straight twigs nimbus two thousand written gold near top as seven oclock drew nearer harry left castle set off dusk toward quidditch field held never been inside stadium before hundreds seats were raised stands around field so that spectators were high enough see what was going on at either end field were three golden poles with hoops on end they reminded harry little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high too eager fly again wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick kicked off from ground what feeling he swooped out goal posts then sped up down field nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived fie was carrying large wooden crate under his arm harry landed next him very nice said wood his eyes glinting see what mcgonagall meant you really are natural im just going teach you rules this evening then youll be joining team practice three times week he opened crate inside were four differentsized balls right said wood now quidditch is easy enough understand even if its not too easy play are seven players on each side three them are called chasers three chasers harry repeated as wood took out bright red ball about size soccer ball this balls called quaffle said wood chasers throw quaffle each other try get it through one hoops score goal ten points every time quaffle goes through one hoops follow me chasers throw quaffle put it through hoops score harry recited so thats sort like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isnt it whats basketball said wood curiously never mind said harry quickly now theres another player on each side whos called keeper im keeper for gryffindor have fly around our hoops stop other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said harry who was determined remember it all they play with quaffle okay got that so what are they for he pointed at three balls left inside box ill show you now said wood take this he handed harry small club bit like short baseball bat im going show you what bludgers do wood said these two are bludgers he showed harry two identical balls jet black slightly smaller than red quaffle harry noticed that they seemed be straining escape straps holding them inside box stand back wood warned harry he bent down freed one bludgers at once black ball rose high air then pelted straight at harrys face harry swung at it with bat stop it from breaking his nose sent it zigzagging away into air it zoomed around their heads then shot at wood who dived on top it managed pin it ground see wood panted forcing struggling bludger back into crate strapping it down safely bludgers rocket around trying knock players off their brooms thats why you have two beaters on each team weasley twins are ours its their job protect their side from bludgers try knock them toward other team so think youve got all that three chasers try score with quaffle keeper guards goal posts beaters keep bludgers away from their team harry reeled off very good said wood er have bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand never at hogwarts weve had couple broken jaws but nothing worse than that now last member team is seeker thats you you dont have worry about quaffle or bludgers unless they crack my head open dont worry weasleys are more than match for bludgers mean theyre like pair human bludgers themselves wood reached into crate took out fourth last ball compared with quaffle bludgers it was tiny about size large walnut it was bright gold had little fluttering silver wings this said wood is golden snitch its most important ball lot its very hard catch because its so fast difficult see its seekers job catch it youve got weave out chasers beaters bludgers quaffle get it before other teams seeker because whichever seeker catches snitch wins his team an extra hundred fifty points so they nearly always win thats why seekers get fouled so much game quidditch only ends when snitch is caught so it can go on for ages think record is three months they had keep bringing on substitutes so players could get some sleep well thats it any questions harry shook his head he understood what he had do all right it was doing it that was going be problem we wont practice with snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside crate its too dark we might lose it lets try you out with few these he pulled bag ordinary golf balls out his pocket few minutes later he harry were up air wood throwing golf balls as hard as he could every direction for harry catch harry didnt miss single one wood was delighted after half an hour night had really fallen they couldnt carry on that quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up castle wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley he could have played for england if he hadnt gone off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings week on top all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that hed already been at hogwarts two months castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had his lessons too were becoming more more interesting now that they had mastered basics on halloween morning they woke delicious smell baking pumpkin wafting through corridors even better professor flitwick announced charms that he thought they were ready start making objects fly something they had all been dying try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad zoom around classroom professor flitwick put class into pairs practice harrys partner was seamus finnigan which was relief because neville had been trying catch his eye ron however was be working with hermione granger it was hard tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this she hadnt spoken either them since day harrys broomstick had arrived now dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top his pile books as usual swish flick remember swish flick saying magic words properly is very important too never forget wizard baruffio who said s instead f found himself on floor with buffalo on his chest it was very difficult harry seamus swished flicked but feather they were supposed be sending skyward just lay on desktop seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand set fire it harry had put it out with his hat ron at next table wasnt having much more luck wingardium leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like windmill youre saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap its winggardium leviosa make gar nice long you do it then if youre so clever ron snarled hermione rolled up sleeves her gown flicked her wand said wingardium leviosa their feather rose off desk hovered about four feet above their heads oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping everyone see here miss grangers done it ron was very bad mood by end class its no wonder no one can stand her he said harry as they pushed their way into crowded corridor shes nightmare honestly someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him it was hermione harry caught glimpse her face was startled see that she was tears think she heard you so said ron but he looked bit uncomfortable she mustve noticed shes got no friends hermione didnt turn up for next class wasnt seen all afternoon on their way down great hall for halloween feast harry ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying girls bathroom wanted be left alone ron looked still more awkward at this but moment later they had entered great hall where halloween decorations put hermione out their minds thousand live bats fluttered from walls ceiling while thousand more swooped over tables low black clouds making candles pumpkins stutter feast appeared suddenly on golden plates as it had at startofterm banquet harry was just helping himself baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into hall his turban askew terror on his face everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledores chair slumped against table gasped troll dungeons thought you ought know he then sank floor dead faint was an uproar it took several purple firecrackers exploding from end professor dumbledores wand bring silence prefects he rumbled lead your houses back dormitories immediately percy was his element follow me stick together first years no need fear troll if you follow my orders stay close behind me now make way first years coming through excuse me im prefect how could troll get harry asked as they climbed stairs dont ask me theyre supposed be really stupid said ron maybe peeves let it for halloween joke they passed different groups people hurrying different directions as they jostled their way through crowd confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed rons arm ive just thought hermione what about her she doesnt know about troll ron bit his lip oh all right he snapped but percyd better not see us ducking down they joined hufflepuffs going other way slipped down deserted side corridor hurried off toward girls bathroom they had just turned corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them percy hissed ron pulling harry behind large stone griffin peering around it however they saw not percy but snape he crossed corridor disappeared from view whats he doing harry whispered why isnt he down dungeons with rest teachers search me quietly as possible they crept along next corridor after snapes fading footsteps hes heading for third floor harry said but ron held up his hand can you smell something harry sniffed foul stench reached his nostrils mixture old socks kind public toilet no one seems clean then they heard it low grunting shuffling footfalls gigantic feet ron pointed at end passage left something huge was moving toward them they shrank into shadows watched as it emerged into patch moonlight it was horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin was dull granite gray its great lumpy body like boulder with its small bald head perched on top like coconut it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet smell coming from it was incredible it was holding huge wooden club which dragged along floor because its arms were so long troll stopped next doorway peered inside it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into room keys lock harry muttered we could lock it good idea said ron nervously they edged toward open door mouths dry praying troll wasnt about come out it with one great leap harry managed grab key slam door lock it yes flushed with their victory they started run back up passage but as they reached corner they heard something that made their hearts stop high petrified scream it was coming from chamber theyd just chained up oh no said ron pale as bloody baron its girls bathroom harry gasped hermione they said together it was last thing they wanted do but what choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted back door turned key fumbling their panic harry pulled door open they ran inside hermione granger was shrinking against wall opposite looking as if she was about faint troll was advancing on her knocking sinks off walls as it went confuse it harry said desperately ron seizing tap he threw it as hard as he could against wall troll stopped few feet from hermione it lumbered around blinking stupidly see what had made noise its mean little eyes saw harry it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went oy peabrain yelled ron from other side chamber he threw metal pipe at it troll didnt even seem notice pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard yell paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time run around it come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying pull her toward door but she couldnt move she was still flat against wall her mouth open with terror shouting echoes seemed be driving troll berserk it roared again started toward ron who was nearest had no way escape harry then did something that was both very brave very stupid he took great running jump managed fasten his arms around trolls neck from behind troll couldnt feel harry hanging but even troll will notice if you stick long bit wood up its nose harrys wand had still been his hand when hed jumped it had gone straight up one trolls nostrils howling with pain troll twisted flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second troll was going rip him off or catch him terrible blow with club hermione had sunk floor fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going do he heard himself cry first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosa club flew suddenly out trolls hand rose high high up into air turned slowly over dropped with sickening crack onto its owners head troll swayed on spot then fell flat on its face with thud that made whole room tremble harry got his feet he was shaking out breath ron was standing with his wand still raised staring at what he had done it was hermione who spoke first is it dead dont think so said harry think its just been knocked out he bent down pulled his wand out trolls nose it was covered what looked like lumpy gray glue urgh troll boogers he wiped it on trolls trousers sudden slamming loud footsteps made three them look up they hadnt realized what racket they had been making but course someone downstairs must have heard crashes trolls roars moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up rear quirrell took one look at troll let out faint whimper sat quickly down on toilet clutching his heart snape bent over troll professor mcgonagall was looking at ron harry harry had never seen her look so angry her lips were white hopes winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys mind what on earth were you thinking said professor mcgonagall with cold fury her voice harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand air youre lucky you werent killed why arent you your dormitory snape gave harry swift piercing look harry looked at floor he wished ron would put his wand down then small voice came out shadows please professor mcgonagall they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed get her feet at last went looking for troll because thought could deal with it on my own you know because ive read all about them ron dropped his wand hermione granger telling downright lie teacher if they hadnt found me id be dead now harry stuck his wand up its nose ron knocked it out with its own club they didnt have time come fetch anyone it was about finish me off when they arrived harry ron tried look as though this story wasnt new them well that case said professor mcgonagall staring at three them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think tackling mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head harry was speechless hermione was last person do anything against rules here she was pretending she had get them out trouble it was as if snape had started handing out sweets miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall im very disappointed you if youre not hurt at all youd better get off gryffindor tower students are finishing feast their houses hermione left professor mcgonagall turned harry ron well still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on fullgrown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five points professor dumbledore will be informed this you may go they hurried out chamber didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up it was relief be away from smell troll quite apart from anything else we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled five you mean once shes taken off hermiones good her get us out trouble like that ron admitted mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked thing with her harry reminded him they had reached portrait fat lady pig snout they said entered common room was packed noisy everyone was eating food that had been sent up hermione however stood alone by door waiting for them was very embarrassed pause then none them looking at each other they all said thanks hurried off get plates but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other knocking out twelvefoot mountain troll is one them chapter eleven quidditch as they entered november weather turned very cold mountains around school became icy gray lake like chilled steel every morning ground was covered frost hagrid could be seen from upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on quidditch field bundled up long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves enormous beaverskin boots quidditch season had begun on saturday harry would be playing his first match after weeks training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor won they would move up into second place house championship hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret but news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow harry didnt know which was worse people telling him hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding mattress it was really lucky that harry now had hermlone as friend he didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what with all lastminute quidditch practice wood was making them do she had also tent him quidditch through ages which turned out be very interesting read harry learned that were seven hundred ways committing quidditch foul that all them had happened during world cup match 1473 that seekers were usually smallest fastest players that most serious quidditch accidents seemed happen them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known vanish turn up months later sahara desert hermione had become bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry ron had saved her from mountain troll she was much nicer for it day before harrys first quidditch match three them were out freezing courtyard during break she had conjured them up bright blue fire that could be carried around jam jar they were standing with their backs it getting warm when snape crossed yard harry noticed at once that snape was limping harry ron hermione moved closer together block fire from view they were sure it wouldnt be allowed unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snapes eye he limped over he hadnt seen fire but he seemed be looking for reason tell them off anyway whats that youve got potter it was quidditch through ages harry showed him library books are not be taken outside school said snape give it me five points from gryffindor hes just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away wonder whats wrong with his leg dunno but hope its really hurting him said ron bitterly gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening harry ron hermione sat together next window hermione was checking harry rons charms homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her read it through they got right answers anyway harry felt restless he wanted quidditch through ages back take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow why should he be afraid snape getting up he told ron hermione he was going ask snape if he could have it better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if were other teachers listening he made his way down staffroom knocked was no answer he knocked again nothing perhaps snape had left book it was worth try he pushed door ajar peered inside horrible scene met his eyes snape filch were inside alone snape was holding his robes above his knees one his legs was bloody mangled filch was handing snape bandages blasted thing snape was saying how are you supposed keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried shut door quietly but potter snapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly hide his leg harry gulped just wondered if could have my book back get out out harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor he sprinted back upstairs did you get it ron asked as harry joined them whats matter low whisper harry told them what hed seen you know what this means he finished breathlessly he tried get past that threeheaded dog at halloween thats where he was going when we saw him hes after whatever its guarding id bet my broomstick he let that troll make diversion hermiones eyes were wide no he wouldnt she said know hes not very nice but he wouldnt try steal something dumbledore was keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or something snapped ron im with harry wouldnt put anything past snape but whats he after whats that dog guarding harry went bed with his head buzzing with same question neville was snoring loudly but harry couldnt sleep he tried empty his mind he needed sleep he had he had his first quidditch match few hours but expression on snapes face when harry had seen his leg wasnt easy forget next morning dawned very bright cold great hall was full delicious smell fried sausages cheer ful chatter everyone looking forward good quidditch match youve got eat some breakfast dont want anything just bit toast wheedled hermione im not hungry harry felt terrible an hours time hed be walking onto field harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan seekers are always ones who get clobbered by other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages by eleven oclock whole school seemed be out stands around quidditch pitch many students had binoculars seats might be raised high air but it was still difficult see what was going on sometimes ron hermione joined neville seamus dean west ham fan up top row as surprise for harry they had painted large banner on one sheets scabbers had ruined it said potter for president dean who was good at drawing had done large gryffindor lion underneath then hermione had performed tricky little charm so that paint flashed different colors meanwhile locker room harry rest team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing green wood cleared his throat for silence okay men he said women said chaser angelina johnson women wood agreed this is it big one said fred weasley

hooch was refereeing she stood middle field waiting for two teams her broom her hand now want nice fair game all you she said once they were all gathered around her harry noticed that she seemed be speaking particularly slytherin captain marcus flint sixth year harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood him out corner his eye he saw fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over crowd his heart skipped he felt braver mount your brooms please harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand madam hooch gave loud blast on her silver whistle fifteen brooms rose up high high into air they were off quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is rather attractive too jordan sorry professor weasley twins friend lee

crowd no sign snitch yet eh nope said ron harry hasnt had much do yet kept outta trouble though thats somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars peering skyward at speck that was harry way up above them harry was gliding over game squinting about for some sign snitch this was part his woods game plan keep out way until you catch sight snitch wood had said we dont want you attacked before you have be when angelina had scored harry had done couple looptheloops let off his feelings now he was back staring around for snitch once he caught sight flash gold but it was just reflection from one weasleys wristwatches once bludger decided come pelting his way more like cannonball than anything but harry dodged it fred weasley came chasing after it all right harry he had time yell as he beat bludger furiously toward marcus flint slytherin possession lee jordan was saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys chaser bell speeds toward wait moment was that snitch murmur ran through crowd as adrian pucey dropped quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at flash gold that had passed his left ear harry saw it great rush excitement he dived downward after streak gold slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too neck neck they hurtled toward snitch all chasers seemed have forgotten what they were supposed be doing as they hung midair watch harry was faster than higgs he could see little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt speed wham roar rage echoed from gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose harrys broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life foul screamed gryffindors madam hooch spoke angrily flint then ordered free shot at goal posts for gryffindor but all confusion course golden snitch had disappeared from sight again down stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref red card what are you talking about dean said ron red card said dean furiously soccer you get shown red card youre out

after that obvious disgusting bit cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagall mean after that open revolting foul jordan im warning you all right all right flint nearly kills gryffindor seeker which could happen anyone im sure so penalty gryffindor taken by spinner who puts it away no trouble we continue play gryffindor still possession it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened his broom gave sudden frightening lurch for split second he thought he was going fall he gripped broom tightly with both his hands knees hed never felt anything like that it happened again it was as though broom was trying buck him off but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide buck their riders off harry tried turn back toward gryffindor goal posts he had half mind ask wood call timeout then he realized that his broom was completely out his control he couldnt turn it he couldnt direct it at all it was zigzagging through air every now then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him lee was still commentating slytherin possession flint with quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard face by bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score no slytherins were cheering no one seemed have noticed that harrys broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from game jerking twitching as it went dunno what harry thinks hes doing hagrid mumbled he stared through his binoculars if didn know better id say hed lost control his broom but he cant have suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over stands his broom had started roll over over with him only just managing hold on then whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given wild jerk harry swung off it he was now dangling from it holding on with only one hand did something happen it when flint blocked him seamus whispered cant have hagrid said his voice shaking cant nothing interfere with broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrids binoculars but instead looking up at harry she started looking frantically at crowd what are you doing moaned ron grayfaced knew it hermione gasped snape look ron grabbed binoculars snape was middle stands opposite them he had his eyes fixed on harry was muttering nonstop under his breath hes doing something jinxing broom said hermione what should we do leave it me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ron turned binoculars back on harry his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him hang on much longer whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as weasleys flew up try pull harry safely onto one their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him broom would jump higher still they dropped lower circled beneath him obviously hoping catch him if he fell marcus flint seized quaffle scored five times without anyone noticing come on hermione ron muttered desperately hermione had fought her way across stand where snape stood was now racing along row behind him she didnt even stop say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into row front reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand whispered few well chosen words bright blue flames shot from her wand onto hem snapes robes it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape realize that he was on fire sudden yelp told her she had done her job scooping fire off him into little jar her pocket she scrambled back along row snape would never know what had happened it was enough up air harry was suddenly able clamber back on his broom neville you can look ron said neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for last five minutes harry was speeding toward ground when crowd saw him clap his hand his mouth as though he was about be sick he hit field on all fours coughed something gold fell into his hand ive got snitch he shouted waving it above his head game ended complete confusion he didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadnt broken any rules lee jordan was still happily shouting results gryffindor had won by one hundred seventy points sixty harry heard none this though he was being made cup strong tea back hagrids hut with ron hermione it was snape ron was explaining hermione saw him he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadnt heard word what had gone on next him stands why would snape do somethin like

nursed back health by hagrid before they could fly off again no one could wait for holidays start while gryffindor common room great hall had roaring fires drafty corridors had become icy bitter wind

malfoy one potions class for all those people who have stay at hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted at home he was looking over at harry as he spoke crabbe goyle chuckled harry who was measuring out powdered spine lionfish ignored them malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since quidditch match disgusted that slytherins had lost he had tried get everyone laughing at how widemouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next then hed realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at way harry had managed stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jealous angry had gone back taunting harry about having no proper family it was true that harry wasnt going back privet drive for christmas professor mcgonagall had come around week before making list students who would be staying for holidays harry had signed up at once he didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be best christmas hed ever had ron his brothers were staying too because mr mrs weasley were going romania visit charlie when they left dungeons at end potions they found large fir tree blocking corridor ahead two enormous feet sticking out at bottom loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through branches nah im all right thanks ron would you mind moving out way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying earn some extra money weasley hoping be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts suppose that hut hagrids must seem like palace compared what your familys used ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up stairs weasley ron let go front malfoys robes he was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind tree malfoy was insultin his family be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily five points from gryffindor weasley be grateful it isnt more move along all you malfoy crabbe goyle pushed roughly past tree scattering needles everywhere smirking ill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys back one these days ill get him hate them both said harry malfoy snape come on cheer up its nearly christmas said hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see great hall looks treat so three them followed hagrid his tree off great hall where professor mcgonagall professor flitwick were busy with christmas decorations ah hagrid last tree put it far corner would you hall looked spectacular festoons holly mistletoe hung all around walls no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds candles how many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid asked just one said hermione that reminds me harry ron weve got half an hour before lunch we should be library oh yeah youre right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out his wand was trailing them over branches new tree library said hagrid following them out hall just before holidays bit keen arent yeh oh were not working harry told him brightly ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel weve been trying find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked listen here ive told yeh drop it its nothin you what that dogs guardin we just want know who nicolas flamel is thats all said hermione unless youd like tell us save us trouble harry added we mustve been through hundreds books already we cant find him anywhere just give us hint know ive read his name somewhere im sayin nothin said hagrid flatly just have find out for ourselves then said ron they left hagrid looking disgruntled hurried off library they had indeed been searching books for flamels name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going find out what snape was trying steal trouble was it was very hard know where begin not knowing what flamel might have done get himself into book he wasnt great wizards twentieth century or notable magical names our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries study recent developments wizardry then course was sheer size library tens thousands books thousands shelves hundreds narrow rows hermione took out list subjects titles she had decided search while ron strode off down row books started pulling them off shelves at random harry wandered over restricted section he had been wondering for while if flamel wasnt somewhere unfortunately you needed specially signed note from one teachers look any restricted books he knew hed never get one these were books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts only read by older students studying advanced defense against dark arts what are you looking for boy nothing said harry madam pince librarian brandished feather duster at him youd better get out then go on out wishing hed been bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left library he ron hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they were sure shed be able tell them but they couldnt risk snape hearing what they were up harry waited outside corridor see if other two had found anything but he wasnt very hopeful they had been looking for two weeks after but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt surprising theyd found nothing what they really needed was nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks five minutes later ron hermione joined him shaking their heads they went off lunch you will keep looking while im away wont you said hermione send me an owl if you find anything you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron itd be safe ask them very safe as theyre both dentists said hermione once holidays had started ron harry were having too good time think much about flamel they had dormitory themselves common room was far emptier than usual so they were able get good armchairs by fire they sat by hour eating anything they could spear on toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows plotting ways getting malfoy expelled which were fun talk about even if they wouldnt work ron also started teaching harry wizard chess this was exactly like muggle chess except that figures were alive which made it lot like directing troops battle rons set was very old battered like everything else he owned it had once belonged someone else his family this case his grandfather however old chessmen werent drawback at all ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them do what he wanted harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him they didnt trust him at all he wasnt very good player yet they kept shouting different bits advice at him which was confusing dont send me cant you see his knight send him we can afford lose him on christmas eve harry went bed looking forward next day for food fun but not expecting any presents at all when he woke early morning however first thing he saw was small pile packages at foot his bed merry christmas said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out bed pulled on his bathrobe you too said harry will you look at this ive got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning his own pile which was lot bigger than harrys harry picked up top parcel it was wrapped thick brown paper scrawled across it was harry from hagrid inside was roughly cut wooden flute hagrid had obviously whittled it himself harry blew it it sounded bit like an owl second very small parcel contained note we received your message enclose your christmas present from uncle vernon aunt petunia taped note was fiftypence piece thats friendly said harry ron was fascinated by fifty pence weird he said nmat shape this is money you can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron was hagrid my aunt uncle so who sent these think know who that ones from said ron turning bit pink pointing very lumpy parcel my mom told her you didnt expect any presents oh no he groaned shes made you weasley sweater harry had torn open parcel find thick handknitted sweater emerald green large box homemade fudge every year she makes us sweater said ron unwrapping his own mines always maroon thats really nice her said harry trying fudge which was very tasty his next present also contained candy large box chocolate frogs from hermione this only left one parcel harry picked it up felt it it was very light he unwrapped it something fluid silvery gray went slithering floor where it lay gleaming folds ron gasped ive heard those he said hushed voice dropping box every flavor beans hed gotten from hermione if thats what think it is theyre really rare really valuable what is it harry picked shining silvery cloth off floor it was strange touch like water woven into material its an invisibility cloak said ron look awe on his face im sure it is try it on harry threw cloak around his shoulders ron gave yell it is look down harry looked down at his feet but they were gone he dashed mirror sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended midair his body completely invisible he pulled cloak over his head his reflection vanished completely theres note said ron suddenly note fell out it harry pulled off cloak seized letter written narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were following words your father left this my possession before he died it is time it was returned you use it well very merry christmas you was no signature harry stared at note ron was admiring cloak id give anything for one these he said anything whats matter nothing said harry he felt very strange who had sent cloak had it really once belonged his father before he could say or think anything else dormitory door was flung open fred george weasley bounded harry stuffed cloak quickly out sight he didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else yet merry christmas hey look harrys got weasley sweater too fred george were wearing blue sweaters one with large yellow f on it other g harrys is better than ours though said fred holding up harrys sweater she obviously makes more an effort if youre not family why arent you wearing yours ron george demanded come on get it on theyre lovely warm hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head you havent got letter on yours george observed suppose she thinks you dont forget your name but were not stupid we know were called gred forge whats all th is noise percy weasley stuck his head through door looking disapproving he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized p for prefect get it on percy come on were all wearing ours even harry got one dont want said percy thickly as twins forced sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew youre not sitting with prefects today either said george christmas is time for family they frogmarched percy from room his arms pinned his side by his sweater harry had never all his life had such christmas dinner hundred fat roast turkeys mountains roast boiled potatoes platters chipolatas tureens buttered peas silver boats thick rich gravy cranberry sauce stacks wizard crackers every few feet along table these fantastic party favors were nothing like feeble muggle ones dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys their flimsy paper hats inside harry pulled wizard cracker with fred it didnt just bang it went off with blast like cannon engulfed them all cloud blue smoke while from inside exploded rear admirals hat several live white mice up at high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for flowered bonnet was chuckling merrily at joke professor flitwick had just read him flaming christmas puddings followed turkey percy nearly broke his teeth on silver sickle embedded his slice harry watched hagrid getting redder redder face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on cheek who harrys amazement giggled blushed her top hat lopsided when harry finally left table he was laden down with stack things out crackers including pack nonexplodable luminous balloons growyourownwarts kit his own new wizard chess set white mice had disappeared harry had nasty feeling they were going end up as mrs norriss christmas dinner harry weasleys spent happy afternoon having furious snowball fight on grounds then cold wet gasping for breath they returned fire gryffindor common room where harry broke his new chess set by losing spectacularly ron he suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if percy hadnt tried help him so much after meal turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle christmas cake everyone felt too full sleepy do much before bed except sit watch percy chase fred george all over gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect badge it had been harrys best christmas day ever yet something had been nagging at back his mind all day not until he climbed into bed was he free think about it invisibility cloak whoever had sent it ron full turkey cake with nothing mysterious bother him fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn curtains his fourposter harry leaned over side his own bed pulled cloak out from under it his fathers this had been his fathers he let material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air use it well note had said he had try it now he slipped out bed wrapped cloak around himself looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight shadows it was very funny feeling use it well suddenly harry felt wideawake whole hogwarts was open him this cloak excitement flooded through him as he stood dark silence he could go anywhere this anywhere filch would never know ron grunted his sleep should harry wake him something held him back his fathers cloak he felt that this time first time he wanted use it alone he crept out dormitory down stairs across common room climbed through portrait hole whos squawked fat lady harry said nothing he walked quickly down corridor where should he go he stopped his heart racing thought then it came him restricted section library hed be able read as long as he liked as long as it took find out who flamel was he set off drawing invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked library was pitchblack very eerie harry lit lamp see his way along rows books lamp looked as if it was floating along midair even though harry could feel his arm supporting it sight gave him creeps restricted section was right at back library step ping carefully over rope that separated these books from rest library he held up his lamp read titles they didnt tell him much their peeling faded gold letters spelled words languages harry couldnt understand some had no title at all one book had dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood hairs on back harrys neck prickled maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought faint whispering was coming from books as though they knew someone was who shouldnt be he had start somewhere setting lamp down carefully on floor he looked along bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book large black silver volume caught his eye he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy balancing it on his knee let it fall open piercing bloodcurdling shriek split silence book was screaming harry snapped it shut but shriek went on on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumbled backward knocked over his lamp which went out at once panicking he heard footsteps coming down corridor outside stuffing shrieking book back on shelf he ran for it he passed filch doorway filchs pale wild eyes looked straight through him harry slipped under filchs outstretched arm streaked off up corridor books shrieks still ringing his ears he came sudden halt front tall suit armor he had been so busy getting away from library he hadnt paid attention where he was going perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he was at all was suit armor near kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above you asked me come directly you professor if anyone was wandering around at night somebodys been library restricted section harry felt blood drain out his face wherever he was filch must know shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer his horror it was snape who replied restricted section well they cant be far well catch them harry stood rooted spot as filch snape came around corner ahead they couldnt see him course but it was narrow corridor if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him cloak didnt stop him from being solid he backed away as quietly as he could door stood ajar his left it was his only hope he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not move it his relief he managed get inside room without their noticing anything they walked straight past harry leaned against wall breathing deeply listening their footsteps dying away that had been close very close it was few seconds before he noticed anything about room he had hidden it looked like an unused classroom dark shapes desks chairs were piled against walls was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against wall facing him was something that didnt look as if it belonged something that looked as if someone had just put it keep it out way it was magnificent mirror as high as ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet was an inscription carved around top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that was no sound filch snape harry moved nearer mirror wanting look at himself but see no reflection again he stepped front it he had clap his hands his mouth stop himself from screaming he whirled around his heart was pounding far more furiously than when book had screamed for he had seen not only himself mirror but whole crowd people standing right behind him but room was empty breathing very fast he turned slowly back mirror he was reflected it white scaredlooking reflected behind him were at least ten others harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was or were they all invisible too was he fact room full invisible people this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not he looked mirror again woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him waving he reached out hand felt air behind him if she was really hed touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she others existed only mirror she was very pretty woman she had dark red hair her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging little closer glass bright green exactly same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at same time tall thin blackhaired man standing next her put his arm around her he wore glasses his hair was very untidy it stuck up at back just as harrys did harry was so close mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that his reflection mom he whispered dad they just looked at him smiling slowly harry looked into faces other people mirror saw other pairs green eyes like his other noses like his even little old man who looked as though he had harrys knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for first time his life potters smiled waved at harry he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against glass as though he was hoping fall right through it reach them he had powerful kind ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness how long he stood he didnt know reflections did not fade he looked looked until distant noise brought him back his senses he couldnt stay here he had find his way back bed he tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered ill come back hurried from room you could have woken me up said ron crossly you can come tonight im going back want show you mirror id like see your mom dad ron said eagerly want see all your family all weasleys youll be able show me your other brothers everyone you can see them any old time said ron just come round my house this summer anyway maybe it only shows dead people shame about not finding flamel though have some bacon or something why arent you eating anything harry couldnt eat he had seen his parents would be seeing them again tonight he had almost forgotten about flamel it didnt seem very important anymore who cared what three headed dog was guarding what did it matter if snape stole it really are you all right said ron you look odd what harry feared most was that he might not be able find mirror room again with ron covered cloak too they had walk much more slowly next night they tried retracing harrys route from library wandering around dark passageways for nearly an hour im freezing said ron lets forget it go back no harry hissed know its here somewhere they passed ghost tall witch gliding opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted suit armor its here just here yes they pushed door open harry dropped cloak from around his shoulders ran mirror they were his mother father beamed at sight him see harry whispered cant see anything look look at them all are loads them can only see you look it properly go on stand where am harry stepped aside but with ron front mirror he couldnt see his family anymore just ron his paisley pajamas ron though was staring transfixed at his image look at me he said can you see all your family standing around you no im alone but im different look older im head boy what am im wearing badge like bill used im holding house cup quidditch cup im quidditch captain too ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight look excitedly at harry do you think this mirror shows future how can it all my family are dead let me have another look you had it yourself all last night give me bit more time youre only holding quidditch cup whats interesting about that want see my parents dont push me sudden noise outside corridor put an end their discussion they hadnt realized how loudly they had been talking quick ron threw cloak back over them as luminous eyes mrs norris came round door ron harry stood quite still both thinking same thing did cloak work on cats after what seemed an age she turned left this isnt safe she might have gone for filch bet she heard us come on ron pulled harry out room snow still hadnt melted next morning want play chess harry said ron no why dont we go down visit hagrid no you go know what youre thinking about harry that mirror dont go back tonight why not dunno ive just got bad feeling about it anyway youve had too many close shaves already filch snape mrs norris are wandering around so what if they cant see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something over you sound like hermione im serious harry dont go but harry only had one thought his head which was get back front mirror ron wasnt going stop him that third night he found his way more quickly than before he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didnt meet anyone were his mother father smiling at him again one his grandfathers nodding happily harry sank down sit on floor front mirror was nothing stop him from staying here all night with his family nothing at all except so back again harry harry felt as though his insides had turned ice he looked behind him sitting on one desks by wall was none other than albus dumbledore harry must have walked straight past him so desperate get mirror he hadnt noticed him didnt see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore harry was relieved see that he was smiling so said dumbledore slipping off desk sit on floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered delights mirror erised didnt know it was called that sir but expect youve realized by now what it does it well it shows me my family it showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know dont need cloak become invisible said dumbledore gently now can you think what mirror erised shows us all harry shook his head let me explain happiest man on earth would be able use mirror erised like normal mirror that is he would look into it see himself exactly as he is does that help harry thought then he said slowly it shows us what we want whatever we want yes no said dumbledore quietly it shows us nothing more or less than deepest most desperate desire our hearts you who have never known your family see them standing around you ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone best all them however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible mirror will be moved new home tomorrow harry ask you not go looking for it again if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared it does not do dwell on dreams forget live remember that now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on get off bed harry stood up sir professor dumbledore can ask you something obviously youve just done so dumbledore smiled you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look mirror see myself holding pair thick woolen socks harry stared one can never have enough socks said dumbledore another christmas has come gone didnt get single pair people will insist on giving me books it was only when he was back bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite personal question chapter thirteen nicolas flamel dumbledore had convinced harry not go looking for mirror erised again for rest christmas holidays invisibility cloak stayed folded at bottom his trunk harry wished he could forget what hed seen mirror as easily but he couldnt he started having nightmares over over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing flash green light while high voice cackled with laughter you see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these drearns hermione who came back day before term started took different view things she was torn between horror at idea harry being out bed roaming school three nights row if filch had caught you disappointment that he hadnt at least found out who nicolas flamel was they had almost given up hope ever finding flamel li brary book even though harry was still sure hed read name somewhere once term had started they were back skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks harry had even less time than other two because quidditch practice had started again wood was working team harder than ever even endless rain that had replaced snow couldnt dampen his spirits weasleys complained that wood was becoming fanatic but harry was on woods side if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin house championship for first time seven years quite apart from wanting win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training then during one particularly wet muddy practice session wood gave team bit bad news hed just gotten very angry with weasleys who kept divebombing each other pretending fall off their brooms will you stop messing around he yelled thats exactly sort thing thatll lose us match snapes refereeing this time hell be looking for any excuse knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words snapes refereeing he spluttered through mouthful mud whens he ever refereed quidditch match hes not going be fair if we might overtake slytherin rest team landed next george complain too its not my fault said wood weve just got make sure we play clean game so snape hasnt got an excuse pick on us which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch rest team hung back talk one another as usual at end practice but harry headed straight back gryffindor common room where he found ron hermione playing chess chess was only thing hermione ever lost at something harry ron thought was very good for her dont talk me for moment said ron when harry sat down next him need concen he caught sight harrys face whats matter with you you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told other two about snapes sudden sinister desire be quidditch referee dont play said hermione at once say youre ill said ron pretend break your leg hermione suggested really break your leg said ron cant said harry isnt reserve seeker if back out gryffindor cant play at all at that moment neville toppled into common room how he had managed climb through portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as leglocker curse he must have had bunny hop all way up gryffindor tower everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up performed countercurse nevilles legs sprang apart he got his feet trembling what happened hermione asked him leading him over sit with harry ron malfoy said neville shakily met him outside library he said hed been looking for someone practice that on go professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville report him neville shook his head dont want more trouble he mumbled youve got stand up him neville said ron hes used walking all over people but thats no reason lie down front him make it easier theres no need tell me im not brave enough be gryffindor malfoys already done that neville choked out harry felt pocket his robes pulled out chocolate frog very last one from box hermione had given him for christmas he gave it neville who looked as though he might cry youre worth twelve malfoy harry said sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didnt it wheres malfoy stinking slytherin nevilles lips twitched weak smile as he unwrapped frog thanks harry think ill go bed dyou want card you collect them dont you as neville walked away harry looked at famous wizard card dumbledore again he said he was first one ever he gasped he stared at back card then he looked up at ron hermione ive found him he whispered ive found flamel told you id read name somewhere before read it on train coming here listen this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat dark wizard grindelwald 1945 for discovery twelve uses dragons blood his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel hermione jumped her feet she hadnt looked so excited since theyd gotten back marks for their very first piece homework stay she said she sprinted up stairs girls dormitories harry ron barely had time exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book her arms never thought look here she whispered excitedly got this out library weeks ago for bit light reading light said ron but hermione told him be quiet until shed looked something up started flicking frantically through pages muttering herself at last she found what she was looking for knew it knew it are we allowed speak yet said ron grumpily hermione ignored him nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is only known maker sorcerers stone this didnt have quite effect shed expected what said harry ron oh honestly dont you two read look read that she pushed book toward them harry ron read ancient study alchemy is concerned with making sorcerers stone legendary substance with astonishing powers stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produces elixir life which will make drinker immortal have been many reports sorcerers stone over centuries but only stone currently existence belongs mr nicolas flamel noted alchemist opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoys quiet life devon with his wife perenelle six hundred fiftyeight see said hermione when harry ron had finished dog must be guarding flamels sorcerers stone bet he asked dumbledore keep it safe for him because theyre friends he knew someone was after it thats why he wanted stone moved out gringotts stone that makes gold stops you from ever dying said harry no wonder snapes after it anyone would want it no wonder we couldnt find flamel that study recent developments wizardry said ron hes not exactly recent if hes six hundred sixtyfive is he next morning defense against dark arts while copying down different ways treating werewolf bites harry ron were still discussing what theyd do with sorcerers stone if they had one it wasnt until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape coming match im going play he told ron hermione if dont all slytherins will think im just too scared face snape ill show them itll really wipe smiles off their faces if we win just as long as were not wiping you off field said hermione as match drew nearer however harry became more more nervous whatever he told ron hermione rest team wasnt too calm either idea overtaking slytherin house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed with such biased referee harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed keep running into snape wherever he went at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying catch him on his own potions lessons were turning into sort weekly torture snape was so horrible harry could snape possibly know theyd found out about sorcerers stone harry didnt see how he could yet he sometimes had horrible feeling that snape could read minds harry knew when they wished him good luck outside locker rooms next afternoon that ron hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive again this wasnt what youd call comforting harry hardly heard word woods pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes picked up his nimbus two thousand ron hermione meanwhile had found place stands next neville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim worried or why they had both brought their wands match little did harry know that ron hermione had been secretly practicing leglocker curse theyd gotten idea from malfoy using it on neville were ready use it on snape if he showed any sign wanting hurt harry now dont forget its locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve know ron snapped dont nag back locker room wood had taken harry aside dont want pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture snitch its now finish game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much whole schools out said fred weasley peering out door even blimey dumbledores come watch harrys heart did somersault dumbledore he said dashing door make sure fred was right was no mistaking that silver beard harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe was simply no way that snape would dare try hurt him if dumbledore was watching perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as teams marched onto field something that ron noticed too ive never seen snape look so mean he told hermione look theyre off ouch someone had poked ron back head it was malfoy oh sorry weasley didnt see you malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe goyle wonder how long potters going stay on his broom this time anyone want bet what about you weasley ron didnt answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff penalty because george weasley had hit bludger at him hermione who had all her fingers crossed her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling game like hawk looking for snitch you know how think they choose people for gryffindor team said malfoy loudly few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all its people they feel sorry for see theres potter whos got no parents then theres weasleys whove got no money you should be on team longbottom youve got no brains neville went bright red but turned his seat face malfoy im worth twelve you malfoy he stammered malfoy crabbe goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring take his eyes from game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than weasley thats saying something rons nerves were already stretched breaking point with anxiety about harry im warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what where harry had suddenly gone into spectacular dive which drew gasps cheers from crowd hermione stood up her crossed fingers her mouth as harry streaked toward ground like bullet youre luck weasley potters obviously spotted some money on ground said malfoy ron snapped before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top him wrestling him ground neville hesitated then clambered over back his seat help come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat watch as harry sped straight at snape she didnt even notice malfoy ron rolling around under her seat or scuffles yelps coming from whirl fists that was neville crabbe goyle up air snape turned on his broomstick just time see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches next second harry had pulled out dive his arm raised triumph snitch clasped his hand stands erupted it had be record no one could ever remember snitch being caught so quickly ron ron where are you games over harrys won weve won gryffindor is lead shrieked hermione dancing up down on her seat hugging parvati patil row front harry jumped off his broom foot from ground he couldnt believe it hed done it game was over it had barely lasted five minutes as gryffindors came spilling onto field he saw snape land nearby whitefaced tightlipped then harry felt hand on his shoulder looked up into dumbledores smiling face well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear nice see you havent been brooding about that mirror been keeping busy excellent snape spat bitterly on ground harry left locker room alone some time later take his nimbus two thousand back broomshed he couldnt ever remember feeling happier hed really done something be proud now no one could say he was just famous name any more evening air had never smelled so sweet he walked over damp grass reliving last hour his head which was happy blur gryffindors running lift him onto their shoulders ron hermione distance jumping up down ron cheering through heavy nosebleed harry had reached shed he leaned against wooden door looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red setting sun gryffindor lead hed done it hed shown snape speaking snape hooded figure came swiftly down front steps castle clearly not wanting be seen it walked as fast as possible toward forbidden forest harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched he recognized figures prowling walk snape sneaking into forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand took off gliding silently over castle he saw snape enter forest at run he followed trees were so thick he couldnt see where snape had gone he flew circles lower lower brushing top branches trees until he heard voices he glided toward them landed noiselessly towering beech tree he climbed carefully along one branches holding tight his broomstick trying see through leaves below shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasnt alone quirrell was too harry couldnt make out look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever harry strained catch what they were saying ddont know why you wanted ttto meet here all pplaces severus oh thought wed keep this private said snape his voice icy students arent supposed know about sorcerers stone after all harry leaned forward quirrell was mumbling something snape interrupted him have you found out how get past that beast hagrids yet bbbut severus you dont want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking step toward him ii dont know what you you know perfectly well what mean an owl hooted loudly harry nearly fell out tree he steadied himself time hear snape say your little bit hocuspocus im waiting bbut dddont very well snape cut well have another little chat soon when youve had time think things over decided where your loyalties lie he threw his cloak over his head strode out clearing it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified harry where have you been hermione squeaked we won you won we won shouted ron thumping harry on back gave malfoy black eye neville tried take on crabbe goyle singlehanded hes still out cold but madam pomftey says hell be all right talk about showing slytherin everyones waiting for you common room were having party fred george stole some cakes stuff from kitchens never mind that now said harry breathlessly lets find an empty room you wait til you hear this he made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting door behind them then he told them what hed seen heard so we were right it is sorcerers stone snapes trying force quirrell help him get it he asked if he knew how get past fluffy he said something about quirrells hocus pocuss reckon are other things guarding stone apart from fluffy loads enchantments probably quirrell would have done some antidark arts spell that snape needs break through so you mean stones only safe as long as quirrell stands up snape said hermione alarm itll be gone by next tuesday said ron chapter fourteen norbert norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought weeks that followed he did seem be getting paler thinner but it didnt look as though hed cracked yet every time they passed thirdfloor corridor harry ron hermione would press their ears door check that fluffy was still growling inside snape was sweeping about his usual bad temper which surely meant that stone was still safe whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort smile ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells stutter hermione however had more on her mind than sorcerers stone she had started drawing up study schedules colorcoding all her notes harry ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them do same hermione exams are ages away ten weeks hermione snapped thats not ages thats like second nicolas flamel but were not six hundred years old ron reminded her anyway what are you studying for you already know it what am studying for are you crazy you realize we need pass these exams get into second year theyre very important

what got theres norwegian ridgeback theyre rare them he looked very pleased with himself but hermione didnt hagrid you live wooden house she said but hagrid wasnt listening he was humming merrily as he stoked fire so now they had something else worry about what might happen hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon his hut wonder what its like have peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all extra homework they were getting hermione had now started making study schedules for harry ron too it was driving them nuts then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid he had written only two words its hatching ron wanted skip herbology go straight down hut hermione wouldnt hear it hermione how many times our lives are

break when bell sounded from castle at end their lesson three them dropped their trowels at once hurried through grounds edge forest hagrid greeted them looking flushed excited its nearly out he ushered them inside egg was lying on table were deep cracks it something was moving inside funny clicking noise was coming from it they all drew their chairs up table watched with bated breath all at once was scraping noise egg split open baby dragon flopped onto table it wasnt exactly pretty harry thought it looked like crumpled black umbrella its spiny wings were huge compared its skinny jet body it had long snout with wide nostrils stubs horns bulging orange eyes it sneezed couple sparks flew out its snout isnt he beautiful hagrid murmured he reached out hand stroke dragons head it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs bless him look he knows his mommy said hagrid hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactly hagrid was about answer when color suddenly drained from his face he leapt his feet ran window whats matter someone was lookin through gap curtains its kid hes runnin back up ter school harry bolted door looked out even at distance was no mistaking him malfoy had seen dragon something about smile lurking on malfoys face during next week made harry ron hermione very nervous they spent most their free time hagrids darkened hut trying reason with him just let him go harry urged set him free cant said hagrid hes too little hed die they looked at dragon it had grown three times length just week smoke kept furling out its nostrils hagrid hadnt been doing his gamekeeping duties because dragon was keeping him so busy were empty brandy bottles chicken feathers all over floor ive decided call him norbert said hagrid looking at

ron remember no charlie your brother charlie romania studying dragons we could send norbert him charlie can take care him then put him back wild brilliant said ron how about it hagrid end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl charlie ask him following week dragged by wednesday night found hermione harry sitting alone common room long after everyone else had gone bed clock on wall had just chimed midnight when portrait hole burst open ron appeared out nowhere as he pulled off harrys invisibility cloak he had been down at hagrids hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by crate it bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped bloody handkerchief im not going be able hold quill for week tell you that dragons most horrible animal ive ever met but way hagrid

difficult think cloaks big enough cover two us norbert it was mark how bad last week had been that other two agreed with him anything get rid norbert malfoy was hitch by next morning rons bitten hand had swollen twice its usual size he didnt know whether it was safe go madam pomfrey would she recognize dragon bite by afternoon though he had no choice cut had turned nasty shade green it looked as if norberts fangs were poisonous harry hermione rushed up hospital wing at end day find ron terrible state bed its not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its about fall off malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted borrow one my books so he could come have good laugh at me he kept threatening tell her what really bit me ive told her it was dog but dont think she believes me shouldnt have hit him at quidditch match thats why hes doing this harry hermione tried calm ron down itll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didnt soothe ron at all on contrary he sat bolt upright broke into sweat midnight on saturday he said hoarse voice oh no oh no ive just remembered charlies letter was that book malfoy took hes going know were getting rid norbert harry hermione didnt get chance answer madam pomfrey came over at that moment made them leave saying ron needed sleep its too late change plan now harry told hermione we havent got time send charlie another owl this could be our only chance get rid norbert well have risk it we have got invisibility cloak malfoy doesnt know about that they found fang boarhound sitting outside with bandaged tail when they went tell hagrid who opened window talk them wont let you he puffed norberts at tricky stage nothin cant handle when they told him about charlies letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on leg aargh its all right he only got my boot jus playin hes only baby after all baby banged its tail on wall making windows rattle harry hermione walked back castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly enough they would have felt sorry for hagrid when time came for him say goodbye norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had do it was very dark cloudy night they were bit late arriving at hagrids hut because theyd had wait for peeves get out their way entrance hall where hed been playing tennis against wall hagrid had norbert packed ready large crate hes got lots o rats an some brandy fer journey said hagrid muffled voice an ive packed his teddy bear case he gets lonely from inside crate came ripping noises that sounded harry as though teddy was having his head torn off byebye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry hermione covered crate with invisibility cloak stepped underneath it themselves mommy will never forget you how they managed get crate back up castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up marble staircase entrance hall along dark corridors up another staircase then another even one harrys shortcuts didnt make work much easier nearly harry panted as they reached corridor beneath tallest tower then sudden movement ahead them made them almost drop crate forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into shadows staring at dark outlines two people grappling with each other ten feet away lamp flared professor mcgonagall tartan bathrobe hair net had malfoy by ear detention she shouted twenty points from slytherin wandering around middle night how dare you you dont understand professor harry potters coming hes got dragon what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on shall see professor snape about you malfoy steep spiral staircase up top tower seemed easiest thing world after that not until theyd stepped out into cold night air did they throw off cloak glad be able breathe properly again hermione did sort jig malfoys got detention could sing dont harry advised her chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about his crate about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out darkness charlies friends were cheery lot they showed harry hermione harness theyd rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them they all helped buckle norbert safely into it then harry hermione shook hands with others thanked them very much at last norbert was going going gone they slipped back down spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them no more dragon malfoy detention what could spoil their happiness answer that was waiting at foot stairs as they stepped into corridor filchs face loomed suddenly out darkness well well well he whispered we are trouble theyd left invisibility cloak on top tower chapter fifteen foribidden forest things couldnt have been worse filch took them down professor mcgonagalls study on first floor where they sat waited without saying word each other hermione was trembling excuses alibis wild cover up stories chased each other around harrys brain each more feeble than last he couldnt see how they were going get out trouble this time they were cornered how could they have been so stupid as forget cloak was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out bed creeping around school dead night let alone being up tallest astronomy tower which was outofbounds except for classes add norbert invisibility cloak they might as well be packing their bags already had harry thought that things couldnt have been worse he was wrong when professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading neville harry neville burst out moment he saw other two was trying find you warn you heard malfoy saying he was going catch you he said you had drag harry shook his head violently shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more likely breathe fire than norbert as she towered over three them would never have believed it any you mr filch says you were up astronomy tower its one oclock morning explain yourselves it was first time hermione had ever failed answer teachers question she was staring at her slippers as still as statue think ive got good idea whats been going on said professor mcgonagall it doesnt take genius work it out you fed draco malfoy some cockandbull story about dragon trying get him out bed into trouble ive already caught him suppose you think its funny that longbottom here heard story believed it too harry caught nevilles eye tried tell him without words that this wasnt true because neville was looking stunned hurt poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him try find them dark warn them im disgusted said professor mcgonagall four students out bed one night ive never heard such thing before you miss granger thought you had more sense as for you mr potter thought gryffindor meant more you than this all three you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you right walk around school at night especially these days its very dangerous fifty points will be taken from gryffindor fifty harry gasped they would lose lead lead hed won last quidditch match fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose professor please you cant dont tell me what can cant do potter now get back bed all you ive never been more ashamed gryffindor students hundred fifty points lost that put gryffindor last place one night theyd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for house cup harry felt as though bottom had dropped out his stomach how could they ever make up for this harry didnt sleep all night he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours harry couldnt think anything say comfort him he knew neville like himself was dreading dawn what would happen when rest gryffindor found out what theyd done at first gryffindors passing giant hourglasses that recorded house points next day thought thered been mistake how could they suddenly have hundred fifty points fewer than yesterday then story started spread harry potter famous harry potter their hero two quidditch matches had lo st them all those points him couple other stupid first years from being one most popular admired people at school harry was suddenly most hated even ravenclaws hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing see slytherin lose house cup everywhere harry went people pointed didnt trouble lower their voices as they insulted him slytherins on other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him theyll all forget this few weeks fred george have lost loads points all time theyve been here people still like them theyve never lost hundred fifty points one go though have they said harry miserably well no ron admitted it was bit late repair damage but harry swore himself not meddle things that werent his business from now on hed had it with sneaking around spying he felt so ashamed himself that he went wood offered resign from quidditch team resign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going get any points back if we cant win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost its fun rest team wouldnt speak harry during practice if they had speak about him they called him seeker hermione neville were suffering too they didnt have as bad time as harry because they werent as wellknown but nobody would speak them either hermione had stopped drawing attention herself class keeping her head down working silence harry was almost glad that exams werent far away all studying he had do kept his mind off his misery he ron hermione kept themselves working late into night trying remember ingredients complicated potions learn charms spells by heart memorize dates magical discoveries goblin rebellions then about week before exams were due start harrys new resolution not interfere anything that didnt concern him was put an unexpected test walking back from library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from classroom up ahead as he drew closer he heard quirrells voice no no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him harry moved closer all right all right he heard quirrell sob next second quirrell came hurrying out classroom straightening his turban he was pale looked as though he was about cry he strode out sight harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed him he waited until quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into classroom it was empty but door stood ajar at other end harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised himself about not meddling all same hed have gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left room from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with new spring his step quirrell seemed have given at last harry went back library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy harry told them what hed heard snapes done it then said ron if quirrells told him how break his antidark force spell theres still fluffy though said hermione maybe snapes found out how get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at thousands books surrounding them bet theres book somewhere here telling you how get past giant threeheaded dog so what do we do harry light adventure was kindling again rons eyes but hermione answered before harry could go dumbledore thats what we should have done ages ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for sure but weve got no proof said harry quirrells too scared back us up snapes only got say he doesnt know how troll got at halloween that he was nowhere near third floor who do you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly secret we hate him dumbledorell think we made it up get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with snape more students get thrown out better hell think dont forget were not supposed know about stone or fluffy thatll take lot explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didnt if we just do bit poking around no said harry flatly weve done enough poking around he pulled map jupiter toward him started learn names its moons following morning notes were delivered harry hermione neville at breakfast table they were all same your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight meet mr filch entrance hall professor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions do furor over points theyd lost he half expected hermione complain that this was whole night studying lost but she didnt say word like harry she felt they deserved what theyd got at eleven oclock that night they said goodbye ron common room went down entrance hall with neville filch was already so was malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten detention too follow me said filch lighting lamp leading them outside bet youll think twice about breaking school rule again wont you eh he said leering at them oh yes hard work pain are best teachers if you ask me its just pity they let old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from ceiling for few days ive got chains still my office keep em well oiled case theyre ever needed right off we go dont think running off now itll be worse for you if you do they marched off across dark grounds neville kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment was going be it must be something really horrible or filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry could see lighted windows hagrids hut then they heard distant shout is that you filch hurry up want ter get started harrys heart rose if they were going be working with hagrid it wouldnt be so bad his relief must have showed his face because filch said suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that oaf well think again boy its into forest youre going im much mistaken if youll all come out one piece at this neville let out little moan malfoy stopped dead his tracks forest he repeated he didnt sound quite as cool as usual we cant go at night theres all sorts things werewolves heard neville clutched sleeve harrys robe made choking noise thats your problem isnt it said filch his voice cracking with glee shouldve thought them werewolves before you got trouble shouldnt you hagrid came striding toward them out dark fang at his heel he was carrying his large crossbow quiver arrows hung over his shoulder abou time he said bin waitin fer half an hour already all right harry hermione shouldnt be too friendly them hagrid said filch coldly theyre here be punished after all thats why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch bin lecturin them eh snot your place ter do that yehve done yer bit ill take over from here ill be back at dawn said filch for whats left them he added nastily

then get back off ter castle an pack go on malfoy didnt move he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze right then said hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous what were gonna do tonight an don want no one takin risks follow me over here moment he led them very edge forest holding his lamp up high he pointed down narrow winding earth track that disappeared into thick black trees light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into forest look said hagrid see that stuff shinin on ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood theres unicorn bin hurt badly by summat this is second time week found one dead last wednesday were gonna try an find poor thing we might have ter put it out its misery what if whatever hurt unicorn finds us first said malfoy unable keep fear out

sparks an well all come an find yeh so be careful lets go forest was black silent little way into it they reached fork earth path harry hermione hagrid took left path while malfoy neville fang took right they walked silence their eyes on ground every now then ray moonlight through branches above lit spot silverblue blood on fallen leaves harry saw that hagrid looked very worried could werewolf be killing unicorns harry asked not fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past mossy tree stump harry could hear running water must be stream somewhere close by were still spots unicorn blood here along winding path you all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry hermione hoisted them off path behind towering oak he pulled out an arrow fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready fire three them listened something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like cloak trailing along ground hagrid was squinting up dark path but after few seconds sound faded away knew it he murmured theres summat here that shouldn be werewolf harry suggested that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful now they walked more slowly ears straining for faintest sound suddenly clearing ahead something definitely moved whos hagrid called show yerself im armed into clearing came was it man or horse waist man with red hair beard but below that was horses gleaming chestnut body with long reddish tail harry hermiones jaws dropped oh its you ronan said hagrid relief how are yeh he walked forward shook centaurs hand good evening you hagrid said ronan he had deep sorrowful voice were you going shoot me cant be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow theres summat bad loose this forest this is harry potter an hermione granger by way students up at school an this is ronan you two hes centaur wed noticed said hermione faintly good evening said ronan students are you do you learn much up at school erm bit said hermione

hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently unusually bright yeah but was meanin anythin unusual bit nearer home said hagrid so yeh havent noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took while answer at last he said forest hides many secrets movement trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again but it was only second centaur blackhaired bodied wilderlooking than ronan hullo bane said hagrid all right good evening hagrid hope you are well well enough look ive jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd here lately theres unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over stand next ronan he looked skyward mars is bright tonight he said simply weve heard said hagrid grumpily well if either you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be off then harry hermione followed him out clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan bane until trees blocked their view never said hagrid irritably try an get straight answer out centaur ruddy stargazers not interested anythin closern moon are many them here asked hermione oh fair few keep themselves themselves mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever want word theyre deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on much dyou think that was centaur we heard earlier said harry did that sound like hooves you nah if yeh ask me that was whats bin killin unicorns never heard anythin like it before they walked on through dense dark trees harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder he had nasty feeling they were being watched he was very glad they had hagrid his crossbow with them they had just passed bend path when hermione grabbed hagrids arm hagrid look red sparks others are trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted stay on path ill come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through undergrowth stood looking at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but rustling leaves around them you dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermione dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got neville its our fault hes here first place minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed be picking up every sigh wind every cracking twig what was going on where were others at last great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville fang were with him hagrid was fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville grabbed him as joke neville had panicked sent up sparks well be lucky ter catch anythin now with racket you two were makin right were changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added whisper harry but hell have harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this done so harry set off into heart forest with malfoy fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper deeper into forest until path became almost impossible follow because trees were so thick harry thought blood seemed be getting thicker were splashes on roots tree as though poor creature had been thrashing around pain close by harry could see clearing ahead through tangled branches an ancient oak look he murmured holding out his arm stop malfoy something bright white was gleaming on ground they inched closer it was unicorn all right it was dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful sad its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen its mane was spread pearlywhite on dark leaves harry had taken one step toward it when slithering sound made him freeze where he stood bush on edge clearing quivered then out shadows hooded figure came crawling across ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy fang stood transfixed cloaked figure reached unicorn lowered its head over wound animals side began drink its blood aaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let out terrible scream bolted so did fang hooded figure raised its head looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front it got its feet came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move for fear then pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hooves behind him galloping something jumped clean over harry charging at figure pain harrys head was so bad he fell his knees it took minute or two pass when he looked up figure had gone centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair palomino body are you all right said centaur pulling harry his feet yes thank you what was that centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on scar that stood out livid on harrys forehead you are potter boy he said you had better get back hagrid forest is not safe at this time especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this way my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back was suddenly sound more galloping from other side clearing ronan bane came bursting through trees their flanks heaving sweaty firenze bane thundered what are you doing you have human on your back have you no shame are you common mule do you realize who this is said firenze this is potter boy quicker he leaves this forest better what have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not set ourselves against heavens have we not read what is come movements planets ronan pawed ground nervously im sure firenze thought he was acting for best he said his gloomy voice bane kicked his back legs anger for best what is that do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business run around like donkeys after stray humans our forest firenze suddenly reared on his hind legs anger so that harry had grab his shoulders stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it was killed or have planets not let you on that secret set myself against what is lurking this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if must firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into trees leaving ronan bane behind them harry didnt have clue what was going on whys bane so angry he asked what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed walk warned harry keep his head bowed case lowhanging branches but did not answer harrys question they made their way through trees silence for so long that harry thought firenze didnt want talk him anymore they were passing through particularly dense patch trees however when firenze suddenly stopped harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by odd question weve only used horn tail hair potions that is because it is monstrous thing slay unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing lose everything gain would commit such crime blood unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at terrible price you have slain something pure defenseless save yourself you will have but halflife cursed life from moment blood touches your lips harry stared at back firenzes head which was dappled silver moonlight but whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going be cursed forever deaths better isnt it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is stay alive long enough drink something else something that will bring you back full strength power something that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden school at this very moment sorcerers stone course elixir life but dont understand who can you think nobody who has waited many years return power who has clung life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over rustling trees he seemed hear once more what hagrid had told him on night they had met some say he died codswallop my opinion dunno if he had enough human left him die do you mean harry croaked that was vol harry harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down path hagrid puffing along behind her im fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying unicorns dead hagrid its that clearing back this is where leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off examine unicorn you are safe now harry slid off his back good luck harry potter said firenze planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs hope this is one those times he turned cantered back into depths forest leaving harry shivering behind him ron had fallen asleep dark common room waiting for them return he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake matter seconds though he was wideeyed as harry began tell him hermione what had happened forest harry couldnt sit down he paced up down front fire he was still shaking snape wants stone for voldemort voldemorts waiting forest all this time we thought snape just wanted get rich stop saying name said ron terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them harry wasnt listening firenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what planets say is going happen they must show that voldemorts coming back bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me suppose thats written stars as well will you stop saying name ron hissed so all ive got wait for now is snape steal stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able come finish me off well suppose banell be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had word comfort harry everyone says dumbledores only one youknowwho was ever afraid with dumbledore around youknowwho wont touch you anyway who says centaurs are right it sounds like fortunetelling me professor mcgonagall says thats very imprecise branch magic sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went bed exhausted their throats sore but nights surprises werent over when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them was note pinned it just case chapter sixteen through trapdoor years come harry would never quite remember how he had managed get through his exams when he half expected voldemort come bursting through door at any moment yet days crept by could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive well behind locked door it was sweltering hot especially large classroom where they did their written papers they had been given special new quills for exams which had been bewitched with an anticheating spell they had practical exams as well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class see if they could make pineapple tapdance across desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn mouse into snuffbox points were given for how pretty snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried remember how make forgetfulness potion harry did best he could trying ignore stabbing pains his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into forest neville thought harry had bad case exam nerves because harry couldnt sleep but truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because was hooded figure dripping blood it maybe it was because they hadnt seen what harry had seen forest or because they didnt have scars burning on their foreheads but ron hermione didnt seem as worried about stone as harry idea voldemort certainly scared them but he didnt keep visiting them dreams they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time fret about what snape or anyone else might be up their very last exam was history magic one hour answering questions about batty old wizards whod invented selfstirring cauldrons theyd be free free for whole wonderful week until their exam results came out when ghost professor binns told them put down their quills roll up their parchment harry couldnt help cheering with rest that was far easier than thought it would be said hermione as they joined crowds flocking out onto sunny grounds neednt have learned about 1637 werewolf code conduct or uprising elfric eager hermione always liked go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down lake flopped under tree weasley twins lee jordan were tickling tentacles giant squid which was basking warm shallows no more studying ron sighed happily stretching out on grass you could look more cheerful harry weve got week before we find out how badly weve done theres no need worry yet harry was rubbing his forehead wish knew what this means he burst out angrily my scar keeps hurting its happened before but never as often as this go madam pomfrey hermione suggested im not ill said harry think its warning it means dangers coming ron couldnt get worked up it was too hot harry relax hermiones right stones safe as long as dumbledores around anyway weve never had any proof snape found out how get past fluffy he nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not going try it again hurry neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down harry nodded but he couldnt shake off lurking feeling that was something hed forgotten do something important when he tried explain this hermione said thats just exams woke up last night was halfway through my transfiguration notes before remembered wed done that one harry was quite sure unsettled feeling didnt have anything do with work though he watched an owl flutter toward school across bright blue sky note clamped its mouth hagrid was only one who ever sent him letters hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how get past fluffy never but harry suddenly jumped his feet wherere you going said ron sleepily ive just thought something said harry he had turned white weve got go see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying

people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law lucky they found hagrid dont you think why didnt see it before what are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across grounds

rather bravely harry ron thought see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was very fishy thing want do why harry swallowed now what its sort secret he said but he wished at once he hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostrils flared professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly he received an urgent owl from ministry magic flew off for london at once hes gone said harry frantically now professor dumbledore is very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time but this is important something you have say is more important than ministry magic potter look said harry throwing caution winds professor its about sorcerers tone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasnt that books she was carrying tumbled out her arms but she didnt pick them up how do you know she spluttered professor think know that sn that someones going try steal stone ive got talk professor dumbledore she eyed him with mixture shock suspicion professor dumbledore

anywhere near here again ill take another fifty points from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house harry ron went back common room harry had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail when portrait

more after all this was first night he hadnt been upset by it hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping come across one enchantments they were about try break harry ron didnt talk much both them were thinking about what they were about do slowly room emptied as people drifted off bed better get cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching yawning harry ran upstairs their dark dormitory he putted out cloak then his eyes fell on flute hagrid had given him for christmas he pocketed it use on fluffy he didnt feel much like singing he ran back down common room wed better put cloak on here make sure it covers all three us if filch spots one our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said voice from corner room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor toad who looked as though hed been making another bid for freedom nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting cloak behind his back neville stared at their guilty faces youre going out again he said no no no said hermione no were not why dont you go bed neville harry looked at grandfather clock by door they couldnt afford waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy sleep you cant go out said neville youll be caught again gryffindor will be even more trouble you dont understand said harry this is important but neville was clearly steeling himself do something desperate wont let you do it he said hurrying stand front portrait hole ill ill fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole dont be an idiot dont you call me an idiot said neville dont think you should be breaking any more rules you were one who told me stand up people yes but not us said ron exasperation neville you dont know what youre doing he took step forward neville dropped trevor toad who leapt out sight go on then try hit me said neville raising his fists im ready harry turned hermione do something he said desperately hermione stepped forward neville she said im really really sorry about this she raised her wand petrificus totalus she cried pointing it at neville nevilles arms snapped his sides his legs sprang together his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood then fell flat on his face stiff as board hermione ran turn him over nevilles jaws were jammed together so he couldnt speak only his eyes were moving looking at them horror whatve you done him harry whispered its full bodybind said hermione miserably oh neville im so sorry we had neville no time explain said harry youll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him pulled on invisibility cloak but leaving neville lying motionless on floor didnt feel like very good omen their nervous state every statues shadow looked like filch every distant breath wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them at foot first set stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near top oh lets kick her just this once ron whispered harrys ear but harry shook his head as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anything they didnt meet anyone else until they reached staircase up third floor peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening carpet so that people would trip whos he said suddenly as they climbed toward him he narrowed his wicked black eyes know youre even if cant see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up air floated squinting at them should call filch should if somethings acreeping around unseen harry had sudden idea peeves he said hoarse whisper bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out air shock he caught himself time hovered about foot off stairs so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily my mistake my mistake didnt see you course didnt youre invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir have business here peeves croaked harry stay away from this place tonight will sir most certainly will said peeves rising up air again hope your business goes well baron ill not bother you he scooted off brilliant harry whispered ron few seconds later they were outside thirdfloor corridor door was already ajar well you are harry said quietly snapes already got past fluffy seeing open door somehow seemed impress upon all three them what was facing them underneath cloak harry turned other two if you want go back wont blame you he said you can take cloak wont need it now dont be stupid said ron were coming said hermione harry pushed door open as door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears all three dogs noses sniffed madly their direction even though it couldnt see them whats that at its feet hermione whispered looks like harp said ron snape must have left it it must wake up moment you stop playing said harry well here goes he put hagrids flute his lips blew it wasnt really tune but from first note beasts eyes began droop harry hardly drew breath slowly dogs growls ceased it tottered on its paws fell its knees then it slumped ground fast asleep keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out cloak crept toward trapdoor they could feel dogs hot smelly breath as they approached giant heads think well be able pull door open said ron peering over dogs back want go first hermione no dont all right ron gritted his teeth stepped carefully over dogs legs he bent pulled ring trapdoor which swung up open what can you see hermione said anxiously nothing just black theres no way climbing down well just have drop harry who was still playing flute waved at ron get his attention pointed at himself you want go first are you sure said ron dont know how deep this thing goes give flute hermione so she can keep him asleep harry handed flute over few seconds silence dog growled twitched but moment hermione began play it fell back into its deep sleep harry climbed over it looked down through trapdoor was no sign bottom he lowered himself through hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips then he looked up at ron said if anything happens me dont follow go straight owlery send hedwig dumbledore right right said ron see you minute hope harry let go cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down flump with funny muffled sort thump he landed on something soft he sat up felt around his eyes not used gloom it felt as though he was sitting on some sort plant its okay he called up light size postage stamp which was open trapdoor its soft landing you can jump ron followed right away he landed sprawled next harry whats this stuff were his first words dunno some sort plant thing suppose its here break fall come on hermione distant music stopped was loud bark from dog but hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other side we must be miles under school she said lucky this plant things here really said ron lucky shrieked hermione look at you both she leapt up struggled toward damp wall she had struggle because moment she had landed plant had started twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles as for harry ron their legs had already been bound tightly long creepers without their noticing hermione had managed free herself before plant got firm grip on her now she watched horror as two boys fought pull plant off them but more they strained against it tighter faster plant wound around them stop moving hermione ordered them know what this is its devils snare oh im so glad we know what its called thats great help snarled ron leaning back trying stop plant from curling around his neck shut up im trying remember how kill it said hermione well hurry up cant breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest devils snare devils snare what did professor sprout say it likes dark damp so light fire harry choked yes course but theres no wood hermione cried wringing her hands have you gone mad ron bellowed are you witch or not oh right said hermione she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something sent jet same bluebell flames she had used on snape at plant matter seconds two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from light warmth wriggling flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies they were able pull free lucky you pay attention herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by wall wiping sweat off his face yeah said ron lucky harry doesnt lose his head crisis theres no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down stone passageway which was only way forward all they could hear apart from their footsteps was gentle drip water trickling down walls passageway sloped downward harry was reminded gringotts with an unpleasant jolt heart he remembered dragons said be guarding vaults wizards bank if they met dragon fullygrown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered harry listened soft rustling clinking seemed be coming from up ahead do you think its ghost dont know sounds like wings me theres light ahead can see something moving they reached end passageway saw before them brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them it was full small jewelbright birds fluttering tumbling all around room on opposite side chamber was heavy wooden door do you think theyll attack us if we cross room said ron probably said harry they dont look very vicious but suppose if they all swooped down at once well theres no other choice ill run he took deep breath covered his face with his arms sprinted across room he expected feel sharp beaks claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened he reached door untouched he pulled handle but it was locked other two followed him they tugged heaved at door but it wouldnt budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm now what said ron these birds they cant be here just for decoration said hermione they watched birds soaring overhead glittering glittering theyre not birds harry said suddenly theyre keys winged keys look carefully so that must mean he looked around chamber while other two squinted up at flock keys yes look broomsticks weve got catch key door but are hundreds them ron examined lock on door were looking for big oldfashioned one probably silver like handle they each seized broomstick kicked off into air soaring into midst cloud keys they grabbed snatched but bewitched keys darted dived so quickly it was almost impossible catch one not for nothing though was harry youngest seeker century he had knack for spotting things other people didnt after minutes weaving about through whirl rainbow feathers he noticed large silver key that had bent wing as if it had already been caught stuffed roughly into keyhole that one he called others that big one no with bright blue wings feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding direction that harry was pointing crashed into ceiling nearly fell off his broom weve got close on it harry called not taking his eyes off key with damaged wing ron you come at it from above hermione stay below stop it from going down ill try catch it right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward key dodged them both harry streaked after it it sped toward wall harry leaned forward with nasty crunching noise pinned it against stone with one hand ron hermiones cheers echoed around high chamber they landed quickly harry ran door key struggling his hand he rammed it into lock turned it worked moment lock had clicked open key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice ready harry asked other two his hand on door handle they nodded he pulled door open next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at all but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded room reveal an astonishing sight they were standing on edge huge chessboard behind black chessmen which were all taller than they were carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across chamber were white pieces harry ron hermione shivered slightly towering white chessmen had no faces now what do we do harry whispered its obvious isnt it said ron weve got play our way across room behind white pieces they could see another door how said hermione nervously think said ron were going have be chessmen he walked up black knight put his hand out touch knights horse at once stone sprang life horse pawed ground knight turned his helmeted head look down at ron do we er have join you get across black knight nodded ron turned other two this needs thinking about he said suppose weve got take place three black pieces harry hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally he said now dont be offended or anything but neither you are that good at chess were not offended said harry quickly just tell us what do well harry you take place that bishop hermione you 90 next him instead that castle what about you im going be knight said ron chessmen seemed have been listening because at these words knight bishop castle turned their backs on white pieces walked off board leaving three empty squares that harry ron hermione took white always plays first chess said ron peering across board yes look white pawn had moved forward two squares ron started direct black pieces they moved silently wherever he sent them harrys knees were trembling what if they lost harry move diagonally four squares right their first real shock came when their other knight was taken white queen smashed him floor dragged him off board where he lay quite still facedown had let that happen said ron looking shaken leaves you free take that bishop hermione go on every time one their men was lost white pieces showed no mercy soon was huddle limp black players slumped along wall twice ron only just noticed time that harry hermione were danger he himself darted around board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones were nearly he muttered suddenly let me think let me think white queen turned her blank face toward him yes said ron softly its only way ive got be taken nof harry hermione shouted thats chess snapped ron youve got make some sacrifices take one step forward shell take me that leaves you free checkmate king harry but do you want stop snape or not ron look if you dont hurry up hell already have stone was no alternative ready ron called his face pale but determined here go now dont hang around once youve won he stepped forward white queen pounced she struck ron hard across head with her stone arm he crashed floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square white queen dragged ron one side he looked as if hed been knocked out shaking harry moved three spaces left white king took off his crown threw it at harrys feet they had won chessmen parted bowed leaving door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry hermione charged through door up next passageway what if hes hell be all right said harry trying convince himself what do you reckons next weve had sprouts that was devils snare flitwick mustve put charms on keys mcgonagall transfigured chessmen make them alive that leaves quirrells spell snapes they had reached another door all right harry whispered go on harry pushed it open disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both them pull their robes up over their noses eyes watering they saw flat on floor front them troll even larger than one they had tackled out cold with bloody lump on its head im glad we didnt have fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one its massive legs come on cant breathe he pulled open next door both them hardly daring look at what came next but was nothing very frightening here just table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it line snapes said harry what do we have do they stepped over threshold immediately fire sprang up behind them doorway it wasnt ordinary fire either it was purple at same instant black flames shot up doorway leading onward they were trapped look hermione seized roll paper lying next bottles harry looked over her shoulder read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two us will help you which ever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three us are killers waiting bidden line choose unless you wish stay here forevermore help you your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly poison tries hide you will always find some on nettle wines left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death their insides fourth second left second on right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out great sigh harry amazed saw that she was smiling very last thing he felt like doing brilliant said hermione this isnt magic its logic puzzle lot greatest wizards havent got an ounce logic theyd be stuck here forever but so will we wont we course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through black fire one will get us back through purple but how do we know which drink give me minute hermione read paper several times then she walked up down line bottles muttering herself pointing at them at last she clapped her hands got it she said smallest bottle will get us through black fire toward stone harry looked at tiny bottle theres only enough for one us he said thats hardly one swallow they looked at each other which one will get you back through purple flames hermione pointed at rounded bottle at right end line you drink that said harry no listen get back get ron grab brooms from flying key room theyll get you out trapdoor past fluffy go straight owlery send hedwig dumbledore we need him might be able hold snape off for while but im no match for him really but harry what if youknowwhos with him well was lucky once wasnt said harry pointing at his scar might get lucky again hermiones lip trembled she suddenly dashed at harry threw her arms around him hermione harry youre great wizard you know im not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go him me said hermione books cleverness are more important things friendship bravery oh harry be careful you drink first said harry you are sure which is which arent you positive said hermione she took long drink from round bottle at end shuddered its not poison said harry anxiously no but its like ice quick go before it wears off good luck take care go hermione turned walked straight through purple fire harry took deep breath picked up smallest bottle he turned face black flames here come he said he drained little bottle one gulp it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body he put bottle down walked forward he braced himself saw black flames licking his body but couldnt feel them for moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on other side last chamber was already someone but it wasnt snape it wasnt even voldemort chapter seventeen man with two faces it was quirrell you gasped harry quirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at all me he said calmly wondered whether id be meeting you here potter but thought snape severus quirrell laughed it wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold sharp yes severus does seem type doesnt he so useful have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next him who would suspect pppoor ststuttering pprofessor quirrell harry couldnt take it this couldnt be true it couldnt but snape tried kill me no no no tried kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed set fire snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another few seconds id have got you off that broom id have managed it before then if snape hadnt been muttering countercurse trying save you snape was trying save me course said quirrell coolly why do you think he wanted referee your next match he was trying make sure didnt do it again funny really he neednt have bothered couldnt do anything with dumbledore watching all other teachers thought snape was trying stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular what waste time when after all that im going kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers ropes sprang out thin air wrapped themselves tightly around harry youre too nosy live potter scurrying around school on halloween like that for all knew youd seen me coming look at what was guarding stone you let troll certainly have special gift with trolls you must have seen what did one chamber back unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight third floor head me off not only did my troll fail beat you death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage bite snapes leg off properly now wait quietly potter need examine this interesting mirror it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell it was mirror erised this mirror is key finding stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around frame trust dumbledore come up with something like this but hes london ill be far away by time he gets back all harry could think doing was keep quirrell talking stop him from concentrating on mirror saw you snape forest he blurted out yes said quirrell idly walking around mirror look at back he was on me by that time trying find out how far id got he suspected me all along tried frighten me as though he could when had lord voldemort on my side quirrell came back out from behind mirror stared hungrily into it see stone im presenting it my master but where is it harry struggled against ropes binding him but they didnt give he had keep quirrell from giving his whole attention mirror but snape always seemed hate me so much oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes he was at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathed each other but he never wanted you dead but heard

weak you mean he was classroom with you harry gasped he is with me wherever go said quirrell quietly met him when traveled around world foolish young man was then full ridiculous ideas about good evil lord voldemort showed me how wrong was is no good evil is only power those too weak seek it since then have served him faithfully although have let him down many times he has had be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly he does not forgive mistakes easily when failed steal stone from gringotts he was most displeased he punished me decided he would have keep closer watch on me quirrells voice trailed away harry was remembering his trip diagon alley how could he have been so stupid hed seen quirrell that very day shaken hands with him leaky cauldron quirrell cursed under his breath dont understand is stone inside mirror should break it harrys mind was racing what want more than anything else world at moment he thought is find stone before quirrell does so if look mirror should see myseff finding it which means ill see where its hidden but how can look without quirrell realizing what im up he tried edge left get front glass without quirrell noticing but ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped fell over quirrell ignored him he was still talking himself what does this mirror do how does it work help me master harrys horror voice answered voice seemed come from quirrell himself use boy use boy quirrell rounded on harry yes potter come here he clapped his hands once ropes binding harry fell off harry got slowly his feet come here quirrell repeated look mirror tell me what you see harry walked toward him must lie he thought desperately must look lie about what see thats all quirrell moved close behind him harry breathed funny smell that seemed come from quirrells turban he closed his eyes stepped front mirror opened them again he saw his reflection pale scaredlooking at first but moment later reflection smiled at him it put its hand into its pocket pulled out bloodred stone it winked put stone back its pocket as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow incredibly hed gotten stone well said quirrell impatiently what do you see harry screwed up his courage see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented ive won house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again get out way he said as harry moved aside he felt sorcerers stone against his leg dare he make break for it but he hadnt walked five paces before high voice spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lips he lies he lies potter come back here quirrell shouted tell me truth what did you just see high voice spoke again let me speak him facetoface master you are not strong enough have strength enough for this harry felt as if devils snare was rooting him spot he couldnt move muscle petrified he watched as quirrell reached up began unwrap his turban what was going on turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without it then he turned slowly on spot harry would have screamed but he couldnt make sound where should have been back quirrells head was face most terrible face harry had ever seen it was chalk white with glaring red eyes slits for nostrils like snake harry potter it whispered harry tried take step backward but his legs wouldnt move see what have become face said mere shadow vapor have form only when can share anothers body but have always been those willing let me into their hearts minds unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me forest once have elixir life will be able create body my own now why dont you give me that stone your pocket so he knew feeling suddenly surged back into harrys legs he stumbled backward dont be fool snarled face better save your own life join me or youll meet same end as your parents they died begging me for mercy liar harry shouted suddenly quirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him evil face was now smiling how touching it hissed always value bravery yes boy your parents were brave killed your father first he put up courageous fight but your mother neednt have died she was trying protect you now give me stone unless you want her have died vain never harry sprang toward flame door but voldemort screamed seize him next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once needlesharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt as though it was about split two he yelled struggling with all his might his surprise quirrell let go him pain his head lessened he looked around wildly see where quirrell had gone saw him hunched pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top him both hands around harrys neck harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling agony master cannot hold him my hands my hands quirrell though pinning harry ground with his knees let go his neck stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red shiny then kill him fool be done screeched voldemort quirrell raised his hand perform deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up grabbed quirrells face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too then harry knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was keep hold quirrell keep him enough pain stop him from doing curse harry jumped his feet caught quirrell by arm hung on as tight as he could quirrell screamed tried throw harry off pain harrys head was building he couldnt see he could only hear quirrells terrible shrieks voldemorts yells kill him kill him other voices maybe harrys own head crying harry harry he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost fell into blackness down down down something gold was glinting just above him snitch he tried catch it but his arms were too heavy he blinked it wasnt snitch at all it was pair glasses how strange he blinked again smiling face albus dumbledore swam into view above him good afternoon harry said dumbledore harry stared at him then he remembered sir stone it was quirrell hes got stone sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are little behind times said dumbledore quirrell does not have stone then who does sir harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed looked around him he realized he must be hospital wing he was lying bed with white linen sheets next him was table piled high with what looked like half candy shop tokens from your friends admirers said dumbledore beaming what happened down dungeons between you professor quirrell is complete secret so naturally whole school knows believe your friends misters fred george weasley were responsible for trying send you toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic confiscated it how long have been here three days mr ronald weasley miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sit stone see you are not be distracted very well stone professor quirrell did not manage take it from you arrived time prevent that although you were doing very well on your own must say you got you got hermiones owl we must have crossed midair no sooner had reached london than it became clear me that place should be was one had just left arrived just time pull quirrell off you it was you feared might be too late you nearly were couldnt have kept him off stone much longer not stone boy you effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment was afraid it had as for stone it has been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted you did do thing properly didnt you well nicolas have had little chat agreed its all for best but that means he his wife will die wont they they have enough elixir stored set their affairs order then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at look amazement on harrys face one as young as you im sure it seems incredible but nicolas perenelle it really is like going bed after very very long day after all wellorganized mind death is but next great adventure you know stone was really not such wonderful thing as much money life as you could want two things most human beings would choose above all trouble is humans do have knack choosing precisely those things that are worst for them harry lay lost for words dumbledore hummed little smiled at ceiling sir said harry ive been thinking sir even if stones gone vol mean youknow who call him voldemort harry always use proper name for things fear name increases fear thing itself yes sir well voldemorts going try other ways coming back isnt he mean he hasnt gone has he no harry he has not he is still out somewhere perhaps looking for another body share not being truly alive he cannot be killed he left quirrell die he shows just as little mercy his followers as his enemies nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return power it will merely take someone else who is prepared fight what seems losing battle next time if he is delayed again again why he may never return power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said sir are some other things id like know if you can tell me things want know truth about truth dumbledore sighed it is beautiful terrible thing should therefore be treated with great caution however shall answer your questions unless have very good reason not which case beg youll forgive me shall not course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried stop him from killing me but why would he want kill me first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time alas first thing you ask me cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry when you are older know you hate hear this when you are ready you will know harry knew it would be no good argue but why couldnt quirrell touch me your mother died save you if is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love he didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark not scar no visible sign have been loved so deeply even though person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever it is your very skin quirrell full hatred greed ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it was agony touch person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested bird out on windowsill which gave harry time dry his eyes on sheet when he had found his voice again harry said invisibility cloak do you know who sent it me ah your father happened leave it my possession thought you might like it dumbledores eyes twinkled useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off kitchens steal food when he was here theres something else fire away quirrell said snape professor snape harry yes him quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father is that true well they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself mr malfoy then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily funny way peoples minds work isnt it professor snape couldnt bear being your fathers debt do believe he worked so hard protect you this year because he felt that would make him your father even then he could go back hating your fathers memory peace harry tried understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped sir theres one more thing just one how did get stone out mirror ah now im glad you asked me that it was one my more brilliant ideas between you me thats saying something you see only one who wanted find stone find it but not use it would be able get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir life my brain surprises even me sometimes now enough questions suggest you make start on these sweets ah bettie botts every flavor beans was unfortunate enough my youth come across vomitflavored one since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them but think ill be safe with nice toffee dont you he smiled popped goldenbrown bean into his mouth then he choked said alas ear wax madam pomfrey nurse was nice woman but very strict just five minutes harry pleaded absolutely not you let professor dumbledore well course that was headmaster quite different you need rest am resting look lying down everything oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she said but five minutes only she let ron hermione harry hermione looked ready fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself as his head was still very sore oh harry we were sure you were going dumbledore was so worried whole schools talking about it said ron what really happened it was one those rare occasions when true story is even more strange exciting than wild rumors harry told them everything quirrell mirror stone voldemort ron hermione were very good audience they gasped all right places when harry told them what was under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loud so stones gone said ron finally flamels just going die thats what said but dumbledore thinks that what was it wellorganized mind death is but next great adventure always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was so what happened you two said harry well got back all right said hermione brought ron round that took while we were dashing up owlery contact dumbledore when we met him entrance hall he already knew he just said harrys gone after him hasnt he hurtled off third floor dyou think he meant you do it said ron sending you your fathers cloak everything well hermione exploded if he did mean say thats terrible you could have been killed no it isnt said harry thoughtfully hes funny man dumbledore think he sort wanted give me chance think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know reckon he had pretty good idea we were going try instead stopping us he just taught us enough help dont think it was an accident he let me find out how mirror worked its almost like he thought had right face voldemort if could yeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudly listen youve got be up for endofyear feast tomorrow points are all slytherin won course you missed last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but foodll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over youve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmly after good nights sleep harry felt nearly back normal want go feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes can cant professor dumbledore says you are be allowed go she said stiffily as though her opinion professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feasts could be you have another visitor oh good said harry who is it hagrid sidled through door as he spoke as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big be allowed he sat down next harry took one look at him burst into tears its all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face his hands told evil git how ter get past fluffy told him it was only thing he didnt know an told him yeh couldve died all fer dragon egg ill never drink again should be chucked out an made ter live as muggle hagrid said harry shocked see hagrid shaking with grief remorse great tears leaking down into his beard hagrid hed have found out somehow this is voldemort were talking about hed have found out even if you hadnt told him yeh couldve died sobbed hagrid an don say name

hagrid wiped his nose on back his hand said that reminds me ive got yeh present its not stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously at last hagrid gave weak chuckle nah dumbledore gave me day off yesterday ter fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got yeh this it seemed be handsome leathercovered book harry opened it curiously it was full wizard photographs smiling waving at him from every page were his mother father sent owls off ter all yer parents old school friends askin fer photos knew yeh didn have any dyeh like it harry couldnt speak but hagrid understood harry made his way down endofyear feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so great hall was already full it was decked out slytherin colors green silver celebrate slytherins winning house cup for seventh year row huge banner showing slytherin serpent covered wall behind high table when harry walked was sudden hush then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into seat between ron hermione at gryffindor table tried ignore fact that people were standing up look at him fortunately dumbledore arrived moments later babble died away another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully must trouble you with an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what year it has been hopefully your heads are all little fuller than they were you have whole summer ahead get them nice empty before next year starts now as understand it house cup here needs awarding points stand thus fourth place gryffindor with three hundred twelve points third hufflepuff with three hundred fiftytwo ravenclaw has four hundred twentysix slytherin four hundred seventy two storm cheering stamping broke out from slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on table it was sickening sight yes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent events must be taken into account room went very still slytherins smiles faded little ahem said dumbledore have few lastminute points dish out let me see yes first mr ronald weasley ron went purple face he looked like radish with bad sunburn for bestplayed game chess hogwarts has seen many years award gryffindor house fifty points gryffindor cheers nearly raised bewitched ceiling stars overhead seemed quiver percy could be heard telling other prefects my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess set at last was silence again second miss hermione granger for use cool logic face fire award gryffindor house fifty points hermione buried her face her arms harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears gryffindors up down table were beside themselves they were hundred points up third mr harry potter said dumbledore room went deadly quiet for pure nerve outstanding courage award gryffindor house sixty points din was deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred seventytwo points exactly same as slytherin they had tied for house cup if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point dumbledore raised his hand room gradually fell silent are all kinds courage said dumbledore smiling it takes great deal bravery stand up our enemies but just as much stand up our friends therefore award ten points mr neville longbottom someone standing outside great hall might well have thought some sort explosion had taken place so loud was noise that erupted from gryffindor table harry ron hermione stood up yell cheer as neville white with shock disappeared under pile people hugging him he had never won so much as point for gryffindor before harry still cheering nudged ron ribs pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more stunned horrified if hed just had bodybind curse put on him which means dumbledore called over storm applause for even ravenclaw hufflepuff were celebrating downfall slytherin we need little change decoration he clapped his hands an instant green hangings became scarlet silver became gold huge slytherin serpent vanished towering gryffindor lion took its place snape was shaking professor mcgonagalls hand with horrible forced smile he caught harrys eye harry knew at once that snapes feelings toward him hadnt changed one jot this didnt worry harry it seemed as though life would be back normal next year or as normal as it ever was at hogwarts it was best evening harrys life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain trolls he would never ever forget tonight harry had almost forgotten that exam results were still come but come they did their great surprise both he ron passed with good marks hermione course had best grades first years even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one they had hoped that goyle who was almost as stupid as he was mean might be thrown out but he had passed too it was shame but as ron said you couldnt have everything life suddenly their wardrobes were empty their trunks were packed nevilles toad was found lurking corner toilets notes were handed out all students warning them not use magic over holidays always hope theyll forget give us these said fred weasley sadly hagrid was take them down fleet boats that sailed across lake they were boarding hogwarts express talking laughing as countryside became greener tidier eating bettie botts every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns pulling off their wizard robes putting on jackets coats pulling into platform nine threequarters at kings cross station it took quite while for them all get off platform wizened old guard was up by ticket barrier letting them go through gate twos threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out solid wall at once alarming muggles you must come stay this summer said ron both you ill send you an owl thanks said harry ill need something look forward people jostled them as they moved forward toward gateway back muggle world some them called bye harry see you potter still famous said ron grinning at him not where im going promise you said harry he ron hermione
